Jonathan talks about market resilience, but we can’t deliver this without a resilient workforce.
With the years and years of expertise leaving out the door, will Jonathan finally say why we are
continuing with the transformation? It’s hurting our reputation as a regulator which makes
everything we try to do externally, much harder.

What do you think are the benefits of the OD that would actually make Band Ds want to stay at Ofgem?
My understanding is that Band Ds either need to apply for a promotion to a Band E role (but will not
 get paid a Band E salary), or we will have our pay and progression capped. This is very frustrating
 for a large number of staff, and has been raised many times before but has not been addressed.
Level 3 expert track roles also appear to have disappeared, and we are losing a lot of experienced
senior leaders.

What will be done to retain staff over the next year? The restructure should help in the long term but
 for those who have been in their current role for years and not received a substantial pay rise in the
 last two years, they will probably look elsewhere if little can be offered by Ofgem.
