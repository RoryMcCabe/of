221 Jonathan can you please explain why there is always a seemingly never-ending pot of money
available to pay the over-inflated fees for consultants (especially to temporarily fill vacancies)
whereas there is never any money available to reward dedicated and hard-working staff with pay rises?

215 Ofgem seems to be a lower paid Civil Service dept and this is reflective in both attracting and
retaining people - aside from the transformation looking at how we will in future - are we looking
at benchmarking what we pay vs both the market and other CS depts/orgs

122 Many long-serving Ofgem colleagues have left the organisation over the past few months and their
knowledge has been permanently lost. Most leave because they have received better offers from the
private sector or other civil service organisations. Ofgem seems unwilling to pay a little extra to
hold on to these valuable assets, yet is quite happy to spend millions of pounds on consultants and
restructuring. Isn’t this myopic and contrary to our values? We pay consultants many thousands of
pounds per day, but won’t pay an extra £5k or £10k per year to keep loyal colleagues who hold business
critical knowledge and experience?
