Morning, I've not heard any fallout from last week's DNO meeting - are there changes to the templates?
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:40]  Augustin Lorne:  
Hi Rory, apologies I was convinced that I had sent you an email with the updates but checking my outbox I have realised that this wasn't the case...
There are updates to the table yes - I have now uploaded them in the BPDT 
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:41]  Rory McCabe:  
I was holding my breath so running out of o2 now :) 
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:41]  Augustin Lorne:  
ahah very sorry! 
Happy to give you a quick run through if you want 
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:42]  Rory McCabe:  
Which tabs and how big are the changes?
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:42]  Augustin Lorne:  
There has been quite a few changes, but a lot of it was merging/ deleting tables
so hopefully should make it easier! 
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:42]  Rory McCabe:  
that is not good news as I've technically eun out of time and each change is a recode
*run
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:43]  Augustin Lorne:  
yes very sorry about this, we've been having discussions with DNOs up to the end of last week...
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:43]  Rory McCabe:  
send me a list of the tabs and changes and I'll see what time it might take that my managers will want to charge for
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:44]  Augustin Lorne:  
the tables have been fairly contentious and quite key for ED2, so it's taken more time than others
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:44]  Rory McCabe:  
if I'm free
as in available
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:44]  Augustin Lorne:  
ok sounds good - I have listed all changes in the change log but happy to write a short overview if needed
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:44]  Rory McCabe:  
please
 
[?29/?03/?2021 10:44]  Augustin Lorne:  
Thanks for your help on this!
