Hi Rory!
How are you doing?
Any insights on how long this situation will last?

Hi, still off vpn but getting some work done :)

vpn servers did not failover
DDaT are working on it
 
[?16/?07/?2020 11:09]  Monica Gandolfi:

[?16/?07/?2020 11:09]  Rory McCabe:

[?16/?07/?2020 11:29]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Some notes for our call below
 
[?16/?07/?2020 11:29]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Context  
Context

Suppliers are providing comments on draft new questions/templates - by next Wed 22 July 

Final new consumer impact templates need to be ready by Friday 24 July - issue RFI asap in w/c 27 July

Prep as much as possible in advance - be ready to work on incorporating any suppliers' comments between 22 and 24 July

Our plan on how to receive/process the data:

Design goals - we spoke about it already - simplicity for suppliers to fill in, minimize errors in submissions and risk suppliers modify template and facilitate aggregation

Can you work on draft design of templates for early next week, building on the templates sent? Also adding any instructions for suppliers? By next Tuesday say? And then introduce any modifications based on suppliers' feedback?

Do we still need a validation tool with the simple new design?

We plan to continue to use Huddle Covid-19 workspace - will need to clear it from old submissions though - any views?

[?16/?07/?2020 12:09]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Apparently the advice from Data Service is that they are still working on the issue and we should not log in yet
Jonathan Baldry told me
 
[?16/?07/?2020 12:29]  Rory McCabe:  
Should be good now - email is a bit slow
 
[?16/?07/?2020 12:34]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Great thanks!
