Hi, just coding AP1 and RPEs: we need a unit row (# or £m), there are lots of missing formula (dashes) after dummy data i input in the yellow cells, there's no price base in AP1, no draft in RPE, percentage values look too high, RPE cells B23 and 35 need '£m' and can you double-check row H in RPE as it goes from unused to 1.0 to used? I know that is a lot in one go - can call you if you prefer. Thanks
