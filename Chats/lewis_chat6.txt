Hi Rory, would it be possible to review the instructions in the next 30 minutes? we send we would send over to legal before 4
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:29]  Rory McCabe:  
Just sent you my FB on them
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:47]  Lewis Edgar:  
thanks, did Monica say she wanted to use the LVT?
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:48]  Rory McCabe:  
We didn't really work that out yet but it would need reworking as the templates are totally different.
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:49]  Lewis Edgar:  
I think the template should produce pretty clean result anyway
do you think we will be fine without it?
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:52]  Rory McCabe:  
I would hope the locked version will give little room for embellishments but never say never,
but hard to predict checks to go in the tool and also less suppliers to go back to for hand-holding
 
[?03/?08/?2020 15:52]  Lewis Edgar:  
ok, I think with only 22 suppliers and locked version we wont require the LVT
