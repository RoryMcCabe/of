Hi Rory, I hope that you are well? You very kindly completed the form to let us know that you are not yet ready to return your Surface Pro. This is absolutely fine, could you please just provide me with some more details so that I can make a record. If you are able to provide any IT helpdesk reference numbers that would also be very helpful. Many Thanks.

Hi Caroline, how are you doing?! It is a combination of hearing about the nirvana issue the day I received the DF so we were told not to do anything with the new machines just then and an end-of-March deadline to a project that is taking all my time. I am eager to start using it but it'll be a while till I have time to dedicate to the configuration of the hardware / testing of the DS apps on it.

Also, it would be really useful if you had any spare docking stations or monitor cables as I'm currently limited to my SPro screen.
