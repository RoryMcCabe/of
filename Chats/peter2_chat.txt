I realize I sent you teams messages and I don't know if you use it
but I'm in the process of dumping my version of the input files in the K drive
[?05/?05/?2020 11:41] Rory McCabe: 
Not a Teams fan - we use Slack much more
OK, I've found some B files in A and some with extra columns and wrong dates.
[?05/?05/?2020 11:44] Peter Lomas: 
i'm curious what happens if you try aggregating my version.  Note it doesn't fix the dates issues, or the template change, but it should hopefully address the extra columns
I assume teams is to bring us into the slack-like universe, and ditch skype
[?05/?05/?2020 11:45] Rory McCabe: 
All fixes greatly appreciated :) 
[?05/?05/?2020 11:45] Peter Lomas: 
i'm curious what you appreciate about slack and don't like about teams.  I'm no expert on either
[?05/?05/?2020 11:45] Rory McCabe: 
It'd be nice if Teams was any good but the quality sucks on and off VPN as far as we can tell
[?05/?05/?2020 11:45] Peter Lomas: 
they seem similarish
interesting
My feeling has been call quality been at minimum equivalent to skype, on and off the vpn
[?05/?05/?2020 11:46] Rory McCabe: 
and we've used Slack for two years now
[?05/?05/?2020 11:46] Peter Lomas: 
I've not noticed a roaring improvement in calls, but it hasn't been worse either

[?05/?05/?2020 11:48] Peter Lomas: 
my date field overrides for those files are in dateindex.csv on https://gitlab-data.ofgem.gov.uk/LomasP/covid_rfi 
[?05/?05/?2020 11:49] Peter Lomas: 
erg.  Skype does weird things with links
[?05/?05/?2020 11:52] Rory McCabe: 
So your files are in a different folder subtree - if I include them, won't they be duplicates or do you want to compare them with my submission4 aggregates?
[?05/?05/?2020 11:52] Peter Lomas: 
I was thinking the latter
it's an entirely different set of submissions
[?05/?05/?2020 11:53] Rory McCabe: 
OK, maybe later depending on the time I get the aggregates. Yesterday was a late one!
[?05/?05/?2020 11:53] Peter Lomas: 
I am more concerned about repeatability and using the 'latest' submission download, to capture any changes to historical files.. I don't like the fairly manual process of building a master set of inputs
[?05/?05/?2020 11:54] Rory McCabe: 
No, manual sucks
[?05/?05/?2020 11:55] Peter Lomas: 
so I start with any given download, do some checks to see if its likely that any files need to be carried forward from previous downloads (zebra energy is a good example, which I haven't done yet, but generally the answer seems no so far), then run a script which overrides the raw files for certain problems
usually it's just some copy-paste loop which renames some headers or dumps extra columns while printing their contents to the screen (I've looked at each supplier and happy with dumping it)
[?05/?05/?2020 11:57] Peter Lomas: 
but some suppliers like equinor, SSE, robin hood.. the script creates entirely new files and deletes the old ones
[?05/?05/?2020 12:00] Peter Lomas: 
having gone through the process I could make that script a lot more formulaic, and probably screen for certain conditions across all the files and capture a lot of it.. but it just sort of built up this way, and I didn't want to throw things out without casting eyes on it
[?05/?05/?2020 18:21] Peter Lomas: 
did you take a stab running your script on the folder I created?
