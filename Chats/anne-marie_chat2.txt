hey rory
hope you had a nice weekend
just wondering if you knew when the aggregated data would be ready for week 10?
 
[?15/?06/?2020 09:44]  Rory McCabe:  
Had a lot of issues with delays getting the files on Thursday evening and errors Friday so not ready yet. Should be soon though, I'm just in meetings right now
