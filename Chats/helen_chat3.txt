Hi, I know the consultation document is just out but I'm comparing the proposed A&A / D&D org structure slide with our OD slide. Is there a rough correspondence between the 7 subsections of the former and the verticals of the latter? If so, has Data Insight headcount grown to 12 potentially?
 
[?01/?07/?2021 13:21]  Helen Crooks:  
Hi Rory. Yes, there is scope for that area to grow in a number of places, but broader than Data Insights. The details will be shared next Thursday.
 
[?01/?07/?2021 13:21]  Rory McCabe:  
Great, looking forward to it.
 
[?01/?07/?2021 13:22]  Helen Crooks:  
thank you
