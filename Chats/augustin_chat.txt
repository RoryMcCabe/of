Hi Augustin, did you get a change to look at the RPEs tab that I'm trying to code? I think there are a few things to change and we can chat about it Monday if you are free.
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:55]  Augustin Lorne:  
Hi Rory
Apologies, I don't think I received your RPE tab!
Did you send it in an email?
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:57]  Rory McCabe:  
Sorry, thought Dheeraj had mentioned it to you. I can send the list of issues
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:57]  Augustin Lorne:  
Qh no sorry I haven't received anything, yes happy to have a look!
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:58]  Rory McCabe:  
Not sonething for this late in the week, maybe catch-up Monday
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:58]  Augustin Lorne:  
Ok perfect, I'm free most of the day I think so whenever is convenient for you!
 
[?19/?02/?2021 16:59]  Rory McCabe:  
There's an ED meeting in the calendar at 4 but maybe earlier - any time after 10am
and I can code the metadata before the 4pm meet
 
[?19/?02/?2021 17:00]  Augustin Lorne:  
ok sounds good! 
Thanks a lot!
 
[?19/?02/?2021 17:00]  Rory McCabe:  
TY, here's a summary:
missing a unit row (# or £m), missing formula (dashes), no price base in AP1, no draft in RPE, percentage values look too high, RPE cells B23 and 35 need '£m' and row H in RPE goes from unused to 1.0 to used 
We can discuss more fully next week - have a great weekend
 
[?19/?02/?2021 17:01]  Augustin Lorne:  
Ok thanks for flagging, have a good weekend!
