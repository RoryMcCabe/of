Hi, forgot to say the other advantage of holding the live meeting till after the clash is that you see all the questions on the RHS which the wire video does not save.
 
[?29/?04/?2021 14:18]  Elena Bachvarova:  
yup, 
the wire video is a very poor substitute 
 
[?29/?04/?2021 14:19]  Rory McCabe:  
they could bookmark each speaker's block or important questions like the pay freeze that they covered this week  (around 19min28sec)
 
[?29/?04/?2021 14:23]  Elena Bachvarova:  
that's a really good point, each speaker/section to be viewed separately, so you can deep dive on individual topics
 
[?29/?04/?2021 14:26]  Rory McCabe:  
We have so many meetings taking actual work time, it would be nice to have a library of each week's meetings with clear agendas blocked out so the culture becomes cherry-picking the bits of interest from missed calls so you can maximise productivity
