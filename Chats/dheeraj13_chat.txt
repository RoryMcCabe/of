hi rory, got a quick question on the stripping process for the ED BPDT 

there's a line of code in the 40strip worksheets saying 'from utils import strip_and_save_xlsx' - when running the code this module is not found, any idea on the issue? 


no worries if you cant look at this now i can send an email

Sorry, was swamped yesterday  - you can open and run utils.py from <N:\NPC-DS Project\ED\python> in Python/Spyder and it will define the needed functions
