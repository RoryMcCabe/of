[?24/?05/?2021 15:31]  Greg Johnston:  
hey! hope you are well, just wanted to find out if anyone has arranged anything for Michelle heading off on leave card/ gift wise 
can add name/contribute as required
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:33]  Rory McCabe:  
We were just talking about that last week, have a skype session to say bye on Thursday but leaning towards getting her stuff after the birth.
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:33]  Greg Johnston:  
sounds good, just drop me a message when that comes round - have some ideas for useful stuff we've had gifted that might be worth getting her
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:34]  Rory McCabe:  
great, will do
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:34]  Greg Johnston:  
how you getting on anyway?
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:36]  Rory McCabe:  
right now: just listening to Helen's panel on the fair future conference. In more general terms, I've a lot of hope in the new DDI team.
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:36]  Greg Johnston:  
i'm glad, future is looking much more interesting
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:37]  Greg Johnston:  
well, watch out tomorrow for the next Data best practice guidance version. We are launching tomorrow unless comms throw a massive spanner in so it's good to get that out
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:39]  Greg Johnston:  
Steven's replacement might be appointed as early as this week (tomorrow potentially, if she just unilaterally appoints someone) 
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:39]  Rory McCabe:  
good luck with the publication. Wow, that is fast but we need it
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:40]  Greg Johnston:  
yeah, i put my name up but not expecting it. So been in the email chain that suggested she'll have her 'final' decisions to who applied at some point tomorrow 
use of the word final suggests she's past just considering if she will interview/who to interview.
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:41]  Greg Johnston:  
will see
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:43]  Greg Johnston:  
which reminds me, we are coordinating with Steven on when his remaining days in office will be, so if there is anything anyone at your end thinks they could use Steven's input on, let ellie/leo/i know and we can see if we can manage his remaining days 
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:44]  Rory McCabe:  
get him to record ALL his thoughts on tape for us to dig into as a future resource ;) 
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:45]  Greg Johnston:  
i mean, we should've been doing that for the last 3 years i suspect but will ask!
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:46]  Rory McCabe:  
unstructured but no way he can write it all down :) 
Seriously though, we'll miss him
 
[?24/?05/?2021 15:47]  Greg Johnston:  
oh yeah, i'm slightly dreading the avalanche of small things he's been doing that he's forgotten to mention so far
might not be that bad, he has chilled out on all that kind of thing since Helen arrived as he's known he was going for the door
