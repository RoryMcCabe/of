Hey rory! can you let me know what you mean by % ranges up to 10K for Shell A Quan 6/4  
having a difficulty figuring out what is is
it is*
 
[?12/?06/?2020 16:57]  Rory McCabe:  
Sorry, just off a call with my manager.
Yes, that means the Shell supplier A=consumer submission for 6th April included very big percentage numbers up to 10,200
 
[?12/?06/?2020 16:59]  Rory McCabe:  
Quan for the Quantitative file
 
[?12/?06/?2020 16:59]  Winifred Victoria:  
and what does it mean for the 1st point?
the changed data
is it something we can fix, or is it on the supplier 
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:00]  Rory McCabe:  
Yes, those suppliers had issues in their 25/05/2020 files that I'd already fixed previously so I think they were downloading this submission and some older files
I've fixed the issues but just wanted to call out that they might be sending more than we asked which is undoing our efforts to clean.
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:01]  Rory McCabe:  
Hope that is clearer, my email was a bit brief as I was probably too close to the issues to describe them clear enough :)  
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:01]  Winifred Victoria:  
ofcourse, makes sense we will make a note of it and make sure the suppliers are aware of it
We had gone through all of your points
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:02]  Rory McCabe:  
Great
I'm conscious it is 5pm Friday but wanted to get an aggregation out before the w/e
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:03]  Winifred Victoria:  
ofcourse, we got everything done! but its totally up to you if you want to or not
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:03]  Rory McCabe:  
no probs, I'll try it now if you've finished correcting the dates.
Have a good w/e
 
[?12/?06/?2020 17:04]  Winifred Victoria:  
sure! you too rory! have a good one
