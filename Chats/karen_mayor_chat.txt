Hi Karen, I just heard your question in the MED S+T. If you have any specific data needs, please come and talk to us in Data Services and we can see if we can help in any practical way.
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:27]  Karen Mayor:  
Thanks Rory! in terms of specific data needs - my team are very involved with the team and have been having discussions. My question was more related to Ofgem submitting bids for things directorate by directorate and the need for a centralised/strategic bid process for things - I've been mentioning it to any data related team I come across ;)
thanks for getting in touch though!!
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:29]  Rory McCabe:  
No problem. As Elena mentioned, our plan depending on the new CDO is for the analysts currently working on internal data solutions in Data Services to work more closely with the MED team in the new year.
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:30]  Karen Mayor:  
My main concern is that all these budget bids will be in before she starts! obviously we can still change them but that was the reason for my timeline question
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:31]  Rory McCabe:  
I'm constantly amazed by how Ofgem is siloed and runs similar efforts in parallel from budgets to RFI design to data ingestion. 
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:31]  Karen Mayor:  
EXACTLY!
So basically every meeting I go to I mention it :) 
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:32]  Rory McCabe:  
:)
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:32]  Karen Mayor:  
but good to know you're also thinking about it!
Nice to "meet" you Rory! I'm sure we'll chat again!
 
[?18/?11/?2020 14:32]  Rory McCabe:  
Yes, you too
