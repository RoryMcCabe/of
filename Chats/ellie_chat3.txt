Hi Rory 
Wanted to catch up with you on the dashboard for last week's meeting 
What did Helen end up presenting? 
 
[?02/?06/?2021 14:28]  Rory McCabe:  
Hiya and welcome back! In one piece? ;) 
 
[?02/?06/?2021 14:29]  Elena Bachvarova:  
in one piece 
but now suffering from motion sickness because i'm on land 
and i'm adjusting to things not moving

I know Helen had a great reception at the EXCO meeting on Wednesday. We gave her a couple of Tree map visuals in Power BI for the Thursday meeting that she used I think as a picture rather than a dynamic due to not having Power BI. I've an approximation of the scatter graph in Python using the sizing and commitment columns that I will send you too.
 
[?02/?06/?2021 14:34]  Elena Bachvarova:  
that's great news 
yes, it would be good to see those 
Dom is rebuilding a laptop for me, so hopefully I'll migrate devices and have the tools by tomorrow or friday at the latest
