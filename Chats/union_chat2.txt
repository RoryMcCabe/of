Hi Rory. Hope you're doing well. You may know we're doing a petition to get Ofgem to pay all staff the Living Wage. If you support this, would you mind signing? We're speaking to Ofgem later today, so the more signatures we have by then, the better :) https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmkoixSK0WUk2pQRsuzZJIggC3dL8Xj-LyCN9Twt9tstxPtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
