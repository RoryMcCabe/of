Morning Monica, how are you? You mentioned the Guaranteed Standards of Performance dataset as
 the first for us to take a look at. Are there example files on the K: or N: drives I could
 take a look at?
 
[?19/?05/?2021 11:15]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Morning Rory, yes this is at the moment the data set where we carry out most of the collection
 and processing work in a manual way. Please get in touch with Ljuban Milicevic to plan best
 how to make any improvements. I do not think we have anything stored in the K drive. I think
 everything is on Sharepoint, but Ljuban can confirm and explain better. Thanks!

Great, I'll do that, thanks
