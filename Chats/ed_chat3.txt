hi rory - sorry for the late message 
"Also the totals in CV6 are ambiguous and need more precise descriptions to differentiate them as we discussed earlier. "
what was this issue again? 
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:15]  Rory McCabe:  
Hi, it was that the raw format has totals in context but the transformed output loses this so needs the cell to say total of what
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:16]  Dheeraj Viswanath:  
is this for the individual sections? 
oh never mind 
this is column a 
just has totals 
and nothing more 
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:17]  Rory McCabe:  
yep
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:17]  Dheeraj Viswanath:  
great cheers
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:18]  Rory McCabe:  
np
Working on M21 and 22 - the position of the units at column I is a problem. I can get around it but there are side-effects
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:19]  Rory McCabe:  
Is there a reason it is in the middle of the tables?
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:22]  Dheeraj Viswanath:  
not a particular reason but there is a possibiltiy that this will change post xmas - (very linked to policy development) 
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:25]  Rory McCabe:  
OK, keep in mind though that it is a parameter and needs to be defined outside the tables area if at all possible
 
[?16/?12/?2020 18:26]  Dheeraj Viswanath:  
noted
