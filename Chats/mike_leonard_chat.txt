Hi Rory - I was hoping you could help. I understand we were aiming to publish our data best practice guidance in April. I can't find that as of yet, but may be looking in the wrong place. Is the draft guidance published earlier this year still the most recent version?  Thanks Mike

Hi Mike, with Steven Steer away this week, I think the best people to ask are either Leo Franco or Ellie Bachvarova in the MED team.
