hi rory
I'm just doing my regular covid reporting and I am now adding in data services staff
sorry...I clsoed the skype window by accident....where was I...?
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:38]  Steven Steer:  
I am filling in my covid reporting and now incldue data services staff
In Liz's case, can I just check. I'm not aware of any circumstances for her that need to be counted in the reporting
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:39]  Steven Steer:  
the form asks for things such as "are any staff unable to work directly because fo covid"
or indirectly too
are people's normal working hours being interrupted
those kinds of things
I recall I checked for you at our one-to-one, but I forgot to ask about Liz
(or I've forgotten that I did ask??)
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:52]  Rory McCabe:  
Yeah you did ask - we talked about her handling the pressure of an elderly mother but nothing directly to do with Covid
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:53]  Steven Steer:  
ah, yes, thank you.
sorry. My memory drew a blank
It's coming back to me now
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:53]  Rory McCabe:  
she does her hours and is good at managing her time
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:53]  Steven Steer:  
thanks
my memory is so hopeless
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:53]  Rory McCabe:  
the drink?
:) 
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:54]  Steven Steer:  
ha. I've gone so clean living these days. I rarely drink and I've recently nearly cut caffine out my diet. I wish I had an excuse
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:56]  Rory McCabe:  
Need a vice: work to live, not live to work
 
[?17/?02/?2021 14:56]  Steven Steer:  
ha, yes, let's not pretend I don't have vices
