Hi Monica, 
That was an awkward meeting, as I have not talked to Chris or Martin before. The agenda certainly changed from which questions to include or leave out of a simplified RFI and what data checks I could include in my script to more of a completely new RFI based on free updates that does not lend itself to aggregation at all. 
In lieu of confirmation of the preferred direction, I am not sure where that meeting left us with respect to any assistance I / Data Services might give to the new phase. At one point near the end, I thought I heard Chris say that Finance had a different collection / aggregation method in existence or in mind for this going forward.
I will of course be available for the remaining three or four weeks of this phase and for any help I can give to the template design.

Hi Rory 
Agree it was awkward! 
I've already escalated the issue to Kiera and Anthony and we are discussing this tomorrow morning. 
  
[23/06/2020 16:56]  Rory McCabe:  
OK, let me know what you need from me when the dust settles :) 
  
[23/06/2020 16:56]  Monica Gandolfi:  
Sure, I'm sorry I've got you involved and make you waste your time on this ...but I really did not expect this outcome!!!
  
[23/06/2020 16:57]  Rory McCabe:  
No problem, you weren't to know and none of this has been a waste of time. I think our phase has been well received. Maybe there should be two RFIs going forward if they are that different
  
[23/06/2020 16:57]  Monica Gandolfi:  
I'm also contemplating the possibility of carrying out our own request separately 
You read my mind!
