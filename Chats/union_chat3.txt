[?04/?12/?2020 10:39]  Rory McCabe:  
Morning Laura, I was wondering if you saw my email earlier this week. It was your day off but I just wanted to clarify the union wire message about checking settlement status for Irish nationals...
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:40]  Laura Hutton:  
hi rory! yes i did and apologies for not responding. I incorporated it into a wider email to HR feeding back on the poor reception and lack of any context for that guidance. I was hoping to hear back this week to be able to give you a more informative response.
still nothing received as yet, but I will have an answer for you before Christmas
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:42]  Rory McCabe:  
That's great, thanks
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:44]  Laura Hutton:  
no problem - hope you're well!
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:45]  Rory McCabe:  
Yes, glad I can look out at the snow rather than have to travel through it to the office!
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:47]  Laura Hutton:  
agreed! slipper socks and blankets all the way
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:48]  Rory McCabe:  
:)
Except when I have to go out to walk my eager husky who wants the door left open all the time.
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:52]  Laura Hutton:  
alas, I have a desert dog, who literally hides from me when it's cold outside and it's business time 
 
[?04/?12/?2020 10:55]  Rory McCabe:  
Isn't it crazy they are such different breeds but the same species
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:00]  Laura Hutton:  
I sometimes question that. she's more of a deer/cat hybrid
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:02]  Rory McCabe:  
Good point, my guy is sometimes a cat in dog's clothing as he remains white and clean after a muddy walk when the rest of us and the house are a mess
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:03]  Laura Hutton:  
wowee, can we swap?
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:07]  Rory McCabe:  
No way, he's my life but you'd also have to accept white hairs everywhere and been woken up in the middle of the night by his face just silently looking at you doing that brain meld thing to let him out
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:09]  Laura Hutton:  
oh yes, we have that too. Nancy likes to wake up at 2am and stare at me sometimes. 'what dog?' usually snaps her out of it
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:12]  Rory McCabe:  
and then they race back in and are snuggled up asleep before you can close the back door
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:14]  Laura Hutton:  
oh no, she never needs out, she just likes a good long 'I see dead people' stare
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:21]  Rory McCabe:  
lovely, woken for nothing except the affirmation that she is a watchdog and so proud of it she has to wake you up to tell you :) 
 
[?04/?12/?2020 11:23]  Laura Hutton:  
indeed...
