Hey Rory, thanks for responding to my email yesterday.... can i just check with you how long the data cleansing takes by the team i.e. i think MOnica (+4) do that bit, vs how long running the aggregation script takes?
sorry to dwell on this point it's just i keep getting asked by reg finance how long all of this is taking and can we help speed up the process, so if i can go back to them with as much detail as poss that would be helpful

Hi. Closing time for submissions is Thursday lunchtime. Lewis and the team extract and check the files by afternoon. I then work well after COB to get a list of issues to fix and it takes a lot of Friday to fix them. Once everything is clean, the aggregations take about an hour. We've shortened this process from Tuesday to Monday to pre-weekend so I do not think there is anything we can do to pull it back more. We have around 400 files each week and a lot of them need cleaning for multiple issues.
