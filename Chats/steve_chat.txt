Hi, can we possibly postpone our 1:1 as I'm knee-deep in cleansing and analysing the Covid RFI submissions from 141 suppliers?
[?01/?05/?2020 15:40] Steven Steer: 
of course
i have some annual leave next week
but we'll find a time soon
[?01/?05/?2020 15:41] Rory McCabe: 
Thanks, enjoy your time off. You may get a message from the system when I cancel the week I had booked in May but I'll take some days later on.
[?01/?05/?2020 15:42] Steven Steer: 
okay
[?01/?05/?2020 15:43] Rory McCabe: 
I've completed the three mandatory courses and have some feedback for the quarter to add to last quarter's. We can cover all that next time.
[?01/?05/?2020 15:43] Steven Steer: 
Hopefully. I am still unsire of HR deadlines for performance
is there a data services disucssion on it, or am i the only person that has disucssed it with you?
[?01/?05/?2020 15:45] Rory McCabe: 
There was a message on the wire certainly about the courses and I think about the FB. I have FB for Michelle as well and doing some for Sergio too.
Think it is supposed to be byTuesday
[?01/?05/?2020 15:46] Steven Steer: 
probably the fault here is me not doing my duties
i'll speak to HR, who have stopped going via me for your and others' perofmrance ratings
