"RE: Mid year reviews [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Helen,

 

The Ofgem process is largely based on End-Of-Quarter and Mid-Year feedback from our business customers and this takes weeks to collate, especially at the moment with everyone being extra busy with the gas crisis and OD work. For example, one of the colleagues I would ask is out of the office until 23rd.

 

Add to that the fact the Chris and I are working without confirmation of title, level, contract or objectives and I don’t know what our performance is going to be measured against.

 

Is it at all possible to get some time to resolve these issues? If not, I would give both Liz and Sergio the highest ratings for continuing to work in such an ambiguous atmosphere as well as giving high quality assistance to the business.

"RE: Mid year reviews [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory, 

 

Wednesday’s 1:1 was a f2f with Helen as she will be in Glasgow for the COP26 event.  Unfortunately cannot change it to Thursday as that is when Helen will be at t he event or to next week when she will be on leave.

 

I will cancel this meeting as you will have the MYR with her on Tuesday, 23rd -  the week she is back from leave and your regular catch the following Wednesday.

Hi Rory

 

Appreciate the concerns and would say that I am planning for us to have a discussion based about your starting roles / HR proposals as Senior rather than Head Of, and to take account of the challenges we have all had this year. We can back up with evidence in the coming weeks, so getting that feedback is possible.

 

On Liz and Sergio, their roles have not changed substantially and so we should be showing how they have performed against their substantive roles. We will need some statements to substantiate High Performer as opposed to Achieving, so please can we discuss this on Wednesday at 1-1.

 

Thanks

Hi Helen,

 

The Ofgem process is largely based on End-Of-Quarter and Mid-Year feedback from our business customers and this takes weeks to collate, especially at the moment with everyone being extra busy with the gas crisis and OD work. For example, one of the colleagues I would ask is out of the office until 23rd.

 

Add to that the fact the Chris and I are working without confirmation of title, level, contract or objectives and I don’t know what our performance is going to be measured against.

 

Is it at all possible to get some time to resolve these issues? If not, I would give both Liz and Sergio the highest ratings for continuing to work in such an ambiguous atmosphere as well as giving high quality assistance to the business.

"RE: Mid year feedback [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory,

 

Per your request, here is my feedback on the work we’ve been doing together over the past six months.

 

Your contribution to the design and processing of the Covid-19 monitoring RFI, which run between April 2020 and September 2021, has been absolutely vital and critical to its success. As mentioned in more detail in previous feedback, you’ve always delivered what we had previously agreed in an effective and timely manner, flagging issues as appropriate. The accuracy and speed with which you could aggregate the data was instrumental to our ability to deliver our analysis on a quick turnaround.

 

More recently, in August-September you’ve also assisted us in designing the templates for three post Covid-RFIs, one focused on microbusinesses, one on prepayment and one on ‘contingency’ grounds, to be kept ready and activated in case of need. As usual, I really enjoyed working with you in this template development phase: once more, you clearly understood very well our user’s needs and the exchange of comments/ideas was very constructive and helpful – you delivered the templates impeccably as needed and on time for us to share with suppliers. I’m looking forward to working with you again when we will receive the first data submissions under these new RFIs.

 

I hope the above helps!

 

Best regards

 

Monica

Apologies for this being so late but my manager is new to the Ofgem performance review process and has just asked this morning for mid-year reviews by the end of the week.

 

If you have five minutes spare, I’d really appreciate if you would reply to me with any comments on the work that I’ve assisted you with this year.

 

Thank you so much,

Hi Rory,

 

Per your request, here is my feedback on the work we’ve been doing together over the past six months.

 

Your contribution to the design and processing of the Covid-19 monitoring RFI, which run between April 2020 and September 2021, has been absolutely vital and critical to its success. As mentioned in more detail in previous feedback, you’ve always delivered what we had previously agreed in an effective and timely manner, flagging issues as appropriate. The accuracy and speed with which you could aggregate the data was instrumental to our ability to deliver our analysis on a quick turnaround.

 

More recently, in August-September you’ve also assisted us in designing the templates for three post Covid-RFIs, one focused on microbusinesses, one on prepayment and one on ‘contingency’ grounds, to be kept ready and activated in case of need. As usual, I really enjoyed working with you in this template development phase: once more, you clearly understood very well our user’s needs and the exchange of comments/ideas was very constructive and helpful – you delivered the templates impeccably as needed and on time for us to share with suppliers. I’m looking forward to working with you again when we will receive the first data submissions under these new RFIs.

 

I hope the above helps!

 

Best regards

 

Monica

I think Marcia has picked this up.

 

As we’re not now due to chat tomorrow, I do need to understand why / what evidence we have for Liz and Sergio to be high performing. Suggest that we have a quick call later today if you are available?

Hi Rory

 

Appreciate the concerns and would say that I am planning for us to have a discussion based about your starting roles / HR proposals as Senior rather than Head Of, and to take account of the challenges we have all had this year. We can back up with evidence in the coming weeks, so getting that feedback is possible.

 

On Liz and Sergio, their roles have not changed substantially and so we should be showing how they have performed against their substantive roles. We will need some statements to substantiate High Performer as opposed to Achieving, so please can we discuss this on Wednesday at 1-1.

 

Thanks

Hi Helen,

 

The Ofgem process is largely based on End-Of-Quarter and Mid-Year feedback from our business customers and this takes weeks to collate, especially at the moment with everyone being extra busy with the gas crisis and OD work. For example, one of the colleagues I would ask is out of the office until 23rd.

 

Add to that the fact the Chris and I are working without confirmation of title, level, contract or objectives and I don’t know what our performance is going to be measured against.

 

Is it at all possible to get some time to resolve these issues? If not, I would give both Liz and Sergio the highest ratings for continuing to work in such an ambiguous atmosphere as well as giving high quality assistance to the business.

"RE: Feedback Request - Sergio Gonzales [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory,

 

These comments cover the period 9 August to 8 November 2021.  Please pass on the comments to Sergio if you are doing this for the other reviewers.

 

I have worked with Sergio on the PBI reports for complaints.  Sergio is a very intelligent person and worked hard to devise the best PBI data model for the complaints data.  He is always good natured, polite and pleasant to work with.  I have been impressed with his attitude to work and his determination to take on any work that is offered him, whether within the remit of “data scientist” or outside it.  He is also willing to pass on his findings and made an effort to take “show and tell” meetings to explain things.

 

Once he is talking he is confident and can explain things, however I wonder if he is a little shy and reticent to speak up in meetings.  (I am noticing this with other colleagues too).

 

I would be grateful if you could discuss the work on the “data science project” on the questionnaire data.  Sergio was assigned some tickets to work on documenting the work that (mostly) he’d done, but he did not complete the work before our meeting with Helen and Andy on 1 November. He  said that the PBI complaints backup was more urgent which was why he hadn’t worked on these, but please can you explore if he was aware of the tickets and gain a little more insight into this.

 

I think that Sergio is a good member of DDI and should be encouraged to develop his career.  I hope that the new DDI recruitment will help him to practice more as a data scientist.

 

Thanks and kind regards

 

Jeremy.

Hi Max, Liz, and Jeremy,

 

For my Quarterly Performance Review, I’d be grateful if you could write a few lines of feedback on our work (especially, Power BI reports or related discussions) over the past quarter.

 

Feel free to write it in the format you usually use (e.g., what did I do well? What do you think I could do to improve? Etc).

 

It’d be good if you could send it to Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk>  at your earliest convenience, preferably by next week.

 

Many thanks,

"RE: Mid year feedback [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory,

 

More than happy to give you some feedback.

 

 

I’ve worked with Rory for ~18 months on the ED2 Data Transformation project. Key points:

 

*	Rory is extremely conscientious and as such he has managed to deliver a fairly complicated and challenging piece of work to a high standard within the timeframe required.
*	Rory has shown a willingness to help when required which has been invaluable given the technical nature of the project. 
*	His ability to explain aspects of the process in a clear manner, given my limited understanding, has helped me develop skills to go on and transform data myself.
*	Rory shows strong enthusiasm for getting the right outcomes which has benefitted the ED2 team enormously and has saved, and will save us, a significant amount of time when assessing Network company submissions.
*	Rory is well organised which helps given the complex nature of the task.
*	One of the main things is that I, and the team, enjoy working Rory as he’s extremely outgoing and has a positive attitude.

 

I hope this helps but happy to discuss further if you like.

 

Thanks,

 

Chris

If you have five minutes spare, I’d really appreciate if you would reply to me with any comments on the work that I’ve assisted you with this year.

You’ll have seen my very late requests for feedback.  The guys I work with are all involved in the energy crisis work so I’m not holding my breath at getting feedback.  Everyone else has left!

 

I could ask Chris (re Smart Meter, Qlik, RFI) but did him last time or Sergio (re Price Cap local validator and powerbi) but he’s away ?

 

I’ve attached my 1st stab at objectives – hopefully they will do!

I’ve also attached notes of a performance meeting we’ve not had, lol.  Fiction is much easier and better not having a blank piece of paper.

You said to make it high achieving so I’ve tried but still included the grumpy wummin bit at the end.

 

Happy to discuss or change as you see fit.

"Feedback [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Liz,

 

Hope you are well.

 

Myself and Neil wanted to provide the below feedback for you (Neil sent over before his annual leave).

 

Best,

Aoife (and Neil)

 

Making Effective decisions

Having recently upskilled in the price cap teams compliance process, Liz has been responsible for running our local validation process as well as our price cap compliance calculations. This has involved tracking unfamiliar workstreams, using personal judgement to assess data quality and pass on relevant information to compliance colleagues.

Due to our teams stretched resource in responding to current retail market conditions, Liz’s proactive and thorough approach has allowed us to have peace of mind and confidence that the workstream is in good hands whilst we focus on alternative work. In addition, due to Liz’s knowledge and helpful attitude, Liz has also been solving queries for colleagues working on the compliance engagement.

 

*It should be noted that Liz was our first choice in seeking additional resource to assist in cap compliance workstreams

Continue

Communicating and Influencing

Developing self and others

Liz was our teams initial point of contact concerning the updating of Local Validation tools used within our team. After carefully listening to our requests Liz approached our team with several different options to potentially pursue. Going through each iteration carefully and methodically ensuring we did not get lost along the way.

 

Additionally, Liz has been our primary contact regarding ingestion pipelines and has been nothing but accommodating and patient. Having talked us through numerous errors and logs whilst providing additional reading resources to allow us to grow more confident in our use of the platform.

 

Liz has also spotted numerous clunky issues with out of date pipelines, flagged them to us and remedied accordingly.

Thanks to Liz our team was able to decide on the best course of action (informed by Liz’s expertise). With roll-out of an updated validation tool going smoothly, ahead of schedule and meeting the needs we set out during our initial chat.

 

Liz’s approachable and down to earth demeanour has meant that she has become a firm favourite within our team, helping us solve the most frustrating of ingestion pipeline errors, improving our ingestion pipelines, along with providing us the space and materials to allow us to become confident in solving (some)these problems by ourselves.

"RE: Feedback Request - Sergio","Hi Rory,

Happy to provide feedback on the tasks Sergio and I have worked on together in the Q1 & Q2 of 2021.

Sergio has been great to work with – knowledgeable and very patient in his explanations and guidance.

I hope this meets your requirements; any queries please let me know.

Thanks, Liz

 

Price Cap Local Validation

Sergio read the provided requirements and diligently changed them into development requirements for the Local Validator.

Rather than just code it up, he then walked me through what was required and how to develop, test, implement and publish the changes.

Sergio showed great patience in involving me in the development process and implementation, even though it would have been quicker and easier to do himself.

He also liaised with the hub engineers to ensure consistency of validation across both local and ingest validations even though this was not in the remit of his tasks.

Sergio showed excellent knowledge and attention to detail in his allocated tasks and also considered the ‘big picture’ through collaborating with engineers and ensure sharing of knowledge with the team (me and the business users).

 

Excelled in the competencies: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Collaborating and Partnering, Building Capability for All, Delivering supporting services that meet user needs.

 

PowerBI – Complaints Continency

Sergio suggested and let DS team members in the development of PowerBI dashboards as a contingency for the unstable Qlik offering.

As part of this lead role Sergio managed and guided 4 team members through the full PowerBI development lifecycle from installing and configuring PowerBI to refreshing and publishing the resultant dashboards.

Although Sergio did most of the work, including constructing a viable data model, he documented and presented all the steps to the team ensuring we all understood the model and steps involved to produce the dashboards.

Sergio ensured the quality of the delivered product by seeking confirmation of design and output from SMEs in the team and led investigations into discrepancies between PowerBI/ and Qlik results, highlighting issues with the Qlik dashboards.

His eye for detail and quality of work was exceptional particularly leading 4 novices through the process with a steady hand, detailed knowledge and unending patience.

 

Excelled in the competencies: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Collaborating and Partnering, Building Capability for All, Delivering supporting services that meet user needs, Delivering at pace, Managing a quality service.

Hi Max, Liz, and Jeremy,

 

For my Quarterly Performance Review, I’d be grateful if you could write a few lines of feedback on our work (especially, Power BI reports or related discussions) over the past quarter.

 

Feel free to write it in the format you usually use (e.g., what did I do well? What do you think I could do to improve? Etc).

 

It’d be good if you could send it to Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk>  at your earliest convenience, preferably by next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi Rory,

Happy to provide feedback on the tasks Sergio and I have worked on together in the Q1 & Q2 of 2021.

Sergio has been great to work with – knowledgeable and very patient in his explanations and guidance.

I hope this meets your requirements; any queries please let me know.

Thanks, Liz

 

Price Cap Local Validation

Sergio read the provided requirements and diligently changed them into development requirements for the Local Validator.

Rather than just code it up, he then walked me through what was required and how to develop, test, implement and publish the changes.

Sergio showed great patience in involving me in the development process and implementation, even though it would have been quicker and easier to do himself.

He also liaised with the hub engineers to ensure consistency of validation across both local and ingest validations even though this was not in the remit of his tasks.

Sergio showed excellent knowledge and attention to detail in his allocated tasks and also considered the ‘big picture’ through collaborating with engineers and ensure sharing of knowledge with the team (me and the business users).

 

Excelled in the competencies: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Collaborating and Partnering, Building Capability for All, Delivering supporting services that meet user needs.

 

PowerBI – Complaints Continency

Sergio suggested and let DS team members in the development of PowerBI dashboards as a contingency for the unstable Qlik offering.

As part of this lead role Sergio managed and guided 4 team members through the full PowerBI development lifecycle from installing and configuring PowerBI to refreshing and publishing the resultant dashboards.

Although Sergio did most of the work, including constructing a viable data model, he documented and presented all the steps to the team ensuring we all understood the model and steps involved to produce the dashboards.

Sergio ensured the quality of the delivered product by seeking confirmation of design and output from SMEs in the team and led investigations into discrepancies between PowerBI/ and Qlik results, highlighting issues with the Qlik dashboards.

His eye for detail and quality of work was exceptional particularly leading 4 novices through the process with a steady hand, detailed knowledge and unending patience.

 

Excelled in the competencies: Seeing the Big Picture, Changing and Improving, Collaborating and Partnering, Building Capability for All, Delivering supporting services that meet user needs, Delivering at pace, Managing a quality service.

Hi Max, Liz, and Jeremy,

 

For my Quarterly Performance Review, I’d be grateful if you could write a few lines of feedback on our work (especially, Power BI reports or related discussions) over the past quarter.

 

Feel free to write it in the format you usually use (e.g., what did I do well? What do you think I could do to improve? Etc).

 

It’d be good if you could send it to Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:Rory.McCabe@ofgem.gov.uk>  at your earliest convenience, preferably by next week.

 

Many thanks,

 

Sergio
