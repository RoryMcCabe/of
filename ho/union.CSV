"29 January Pay Day rally [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

This Friday we are organising a number of pay day events across all PCS regions. (Yes, I know our pay day was last week, but bear with me :)). These events are the next step in our ongoing campaign for better pay, following on from the debate we secured in Parliament on the 14th of December last year*. The events are set up as online rallies, one for each PCS region, with some keynote speakers. This is an opportunity for you to express strength of feeling about the erosion of your pay, ask questions about the campaign directly to next members of the National Executive Committee, and hear from members elsewhere in the civil service about their experiences.

 

Glasgow

The Glasgow rally will be held from 12:00 to 13:00 via Zoom. You need to register for the event by emailing scotland@pcs.org.uk <mailto:scotland@pcs.org.uk>  and letting them know which branch you are a part of (we’re PSg - Office of Gas & Electricity Markets. Our branch code is 140112). You will then receive the Zoom details to let you join the call. Keynote speakers are Mark Serwotka, our very own general secretary, and Chris Stephens MP who chairs the PCS Parliamentary Group in Parliament.

 

London

The London rally will be held from 13:00 to 14:00 via Zoom.

A message of thanks from Clara Paillard, from the PCS culture Group
Members raised £160 for the PCS Culture Group Strike Fund through their GoFundMe collection (it’s still open!). We got this thank you message from Clara Paillard in the PCS Culture Group:

Campaigns & Events 	
PCS Scotland Online Pay Rally: Friday 29th January, 12 - 1pm
In November, the UK Government announced yet another a pay freeze for civil servants. We are inviting members to get involved in the PCS pay campaign to challenge the government’s proposed freeze, by attending PCS Scotland’s lunchtime meeting on Zoom. 
At this meeting, members will hear an update on pay from the General Secretary, and will also have the opportunity to hear from PCS Parliamentary Group Chair, Chris Stephens MP, who will discuss how we can pressure the government to scrap the pay freeze.
If you’d like to attend, please email scotland@pcs.org.uk <mailto:scotland@pcs.org.uk>  to get the zoom link.
	
Supporting NHS staff
We are gathering messages of support for our NHS staff to hopefully raise any morale we can for our healthcare heroes. Messages will be sent to a Glasgow and London Hospital, next week. If you would like to contribute a message please email it to pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk>  by the end of today! And in these times please stay home, if you can, to support our NHS workers.

"PCS Movie night - Ethical Finance","Good afternoon everyone,

 

As part of Ethical Finance Week <http://ofgemintranet/SpecialismsAndGroups/Groups/Unions/Pages/PCS-Ethical-Finance-Week.aspx>  we are hosting another PCS movie night! :) We have found a good 20 minute overview of ethical finance, its challenges and what options are out there for individuals. As before, we will use the movie as a starting point for some discussion afterwards, for example about what ethical finance options people might already be using or be familiar with.

 

The documentary is available on YouTube here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9o1SKOpaQ_8%26t%3D1014s&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cee4fa7ebd52e4a444cd208d8c6abc35d%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637477788304610214%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ijloEkMnzF%2Fv4%2BXlkQ6cTwkU%2BFimjbfv%2Bp8dVOav0nc%3D&reserved=0> .

PS. Of course, it helps to actually have money when looking to invest it ethically. That is why we’re asking Ofgem to guarantee all staff are paid at least the Real Living Wage. If you agree, and haven’t yet signed our petition, you can do so here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSdmkoixSK0WUk2pQRsuzZJIggC3dL8Xj-LyCN9Twt9tstxPtQ%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cee4fa7ebd52e4a444cd208d8c6abc35d%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637477788304620209%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=MYz%2BZOfeC9Q4spDCIQWPmzvCAbWoMxxzF%2B4mNauPqAU%3D&reserved=0> .

PPS. In light of Ofgem’s announcement that working from home for 3-4 days per week will become the norm, we are running a WFH survey to see how you feel about it, and what sort of support you would like from Ofgem if WFH becomes a permanent feature of our work. If you haven’t yet given your views, you can do so here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSdWY6nmpU_Vb4IXNNuQeYsO690f1SBTECOvX1MncvjcOJP7dg%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cee4fa7ebd52e4a444cd208d8c6abc35d%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637477788304630204%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=sPmFYybD5pgVSc3n1fBTe9WfxyvVlV3xbN%2F3hQl29oA%3D&reserved=0> .

"PCS Annual General Meeting","Dear members,

 

Lockdown or no lockdown, it is the season for the PCS annual general meeting (AGM). This year the AGM is scheduled for 25 February, from 15:00 to 17:30. We are still bolting down the agenda, but wanted to mark the date in your calendar. Items that will feature are:

 

-      Presentation of the annual report and the accounts.

-      Election results for elected positions on the branch executive committee.

-      Discussion of any motions submitted.

 

A template to submit motions is attached. 

 

If you are unsure about how to stand for election, nominate someone or submit a motion, please contact myself or one of the other reps, and we’ll be happy to help out.

 

Cheerio,
Frank

Performance markings - reminder
As we approach the Q4 performance marking discussions, we wanted to remind members that while performance related payments are awarded only on the ratings from Q2 (30th September) and Q4 (31st March), line managers should consider the previous 6 months holistically when determining the Q2 and Q4 box markings, using the Q1 and Q3 markings as indicators.

Update us with where you work in Ofgem
To help us with organising and recruitment, it is really helpful to know what directorate and team everyone is in. But a lot of this information is now from several restructures ago, and so hopelessly out of date! Please fill in our survey below to update your details. Once you have selected a directorate, please also select your hub.

Reducing your hours working part-time
On the all-staff call this week, a colleague asked about taking up a 20-30 hour contract and taking a pay cut so that they could spend more time with their family and less time working. Many people find part-time working great for their work/life balance.

There aren’t a set number of 20-30 hour contracts, and you can actively ask to change your contract and work part-time if you’d like. Do make sure to discuss this with your line manager first as you can only make one formal request for flexible working each year.

Fair Pay for British Council Workers
Following a year when the British Council faced the largest crisis in the organisation since its inception, it wasn’t until December that the British Council was refused additional funding to give staff any sort of pay increase or performance payment in 2020.

PCS lands 'crushing' victory on redundancy payment cap
In November 2020, the government imposed legislative regulations setting a cap of £95,000 on redundancy payments in the public sector. PCS, along with other unions, lodged proceedings with the High Court in order to get the legislation quashed. In what marks a further crushing legal victory for PCS over the government on behalf of our members, the government has now confirmed that they intend to revoke the legislation.

PCS activist wins employment tribunal claim against DVSA
Paul Williams – a member of the union’s NEC who had 38 years as a civil servant, won his case at the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) after a Nottingham ET concluded that his employer had tried to stop him carrying out trade union duties. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said the case demonstrated some of the most appalling anti-trade union practices he’d seen, and thanked Paul for his dedication to the trade union movement.

#SickPayForAll	
The government has chosen to deny British Council staff any cost of living pay increase in 2020. Sign this petition to support British Council staff.

PCS is working to ensure every workplace is taking the necessary steps to keep workers safe. You can share your experience by completing this questionnaire.

Our WFH survey has now closed, and we will be able to share the findings with you and Ofgem in the next few weeks. Thank you to all who responded and shared with colleagues. We received 270 responses, excluding duplicates.

Add your name to this petition by clicking here to show support for Ofgem to pay all staff the Living Wage. Don’t forget to share with your non-union colleagues too!

It is essential that people are able to quarantine without fear of financial loss and debt. Please sign the TUC petition here and demand #SickPayForAll.

AGM: Thursday 25 February
Our Annual General Meeting will take place next week on the 25th of February and we are delighted to confirm that Ofgem has agreed members are allowed to attend during working hours. The AGM will cover appointment of BEC positions, looking back over the past year, and deciding the direction for our branch for the next year. If you want something discussed, the union to support something, or to push for a specific change at Ofgem, please contact Frank Hemmes or complete survey below to &quot;vote&quot; on your priorities for the upcoming year:

Ethical Finance: How does Ofgem stand up?
To finish off Ethical Finance week we discussed the impact of Ofgem’s own banking, as this is with Natwest who are certainly not leading the way in ethics nor sustainability. You can read more about it in this wire article and feel free to read about our  Ethical Finance week here.	
	
	
Reducing your hours working part-time
On the all-staff call this week, a colleague asked about taking up a 20-30 hour contract and taking a pay cut so that they could spend more time with their family and less time working. Many people find part-time working great for their work/life balance.

There aren’t a set number of 20-30 hour contracts, and you can actively ask to change your contract and work part-time if you’d like. Do make sure to discuss this with your line manager first as you can only make one formal request for flexible working each year.

The form is here, and notes here (Ofgem treats a request to work part-time in the same way as a formal flexible working request). Your pay, pensions contribution, and holidays will be calculated pro-rata based on your hours worked. Any change to your contract is permanent, so you can’t automatically switch back, but it’s worth discussing these kind of details with your manager prior to submitting the form.	
	
	
Reminder: Update your directorate and team
An important part of union organising is knowing where your members are, so we can focus our activity and recruitment. But all these pesky restructures at Ofgem make that quite difficult, and some of our details is now quite out of date! Help us get this right again, and use our survey to update your details here:	
	
	
Update your directorate and hub

Fair Pay for British Council Workers
Following a year when the British Council faced the largest crisis in the organisation since its inception, it wasn’t until December that the British Council was refused additional funding to give staff any sort of pay increase or performance payment in 2020. PCS is campaigning for British Council staff to be given fair pay - click here to read more on the issue and show your support by signing their petition.	
	
	
Call for evidence: gendered toilets
An open consultation on the provision of gendered toilets is taking technical comments and, dissappointly enough during LGBT+ month, this consultation wrongfully fails to address the needs of trans- and gender non-conforming people. In addition parents of children with a different gender, or those who care for someone with a different gender are also disadvantaged. To support our already most marginalised we hope our allies submit a technical comment (email to toilets@communities.gov.uk). A publically available google document can be used to guide your response.

We will be joined by Apsana Begum <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theyworkforyou.com%2Fmp%2F25914%2Fapsana_begum%2Fpoplar_and_limehouse&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C327979e8301f41de942f08d8d7f443dc%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637496791428115497%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=31bYfuXeuzZ6qUKXNtNL%2Fv%2Bk2PyU%2BhU6oTzowl0r0QE%3D&reserved=0> , Labour MP for Poplar & Limehouse, which is the constituency that Canary Wharf is in. We also expect to have either our general secretary Mark Serwotka or president Fran Heathcote attending to give an update on the pay campaign, and answer your questions. 

 

We are also asking you to make a sign or poster explaining why you need a pay rise, or support our campaign for fair pay. On closing the rally, we will do a screen capture of all the members holding signs to show the support for the campaign. 

 

Some of you may be from branches that have other workplaces than Canary Wharf. Members who don’t work at Canary Wharf are equally welcome. Canary Club reps, please share this invite with your branches.

 

Rally structure

*	Message of support from Apsana Begum MP.

The rally will be hosted via Microsoft Teams using the link below.

 

Background to our pay campaign

Civil Service pay has been capped ever since the financial crisis in 2007. Although we were promised at the last election that austerity was over, the Government intends to announce a new public sector pay freeze in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This could set the scene for another decade of pay ‘restraint’, with wages falling behind inflation year on year resulting in real term wage cuts. Before Christmas, PCS successfully got over 100,000 signatures for our Parliamentary petition, forcing a debate in Parliament. Building on this success, our pay campaign now powers on, together with other public sector unions and the TUC. With borrowing costs still at historic lows and the economy needing a boost to avoid a prolonged recession, we think not austerity, but investment in workers, society and public services <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcs.org.uk%2Fnews%2Fpcs-mythbuster-number-3-%25E2%2580%2593-the-country-can%25E2%2580%2599t-afford-a-pay-rise-at-the-moment&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C327979e8301f41de942f08d8d7f443dc%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637496791428115497%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=9HxBiDj0T3T%2B8MuyyhpCS4mW9%2Bko2T5SHGtNAzFYGuI%3D&reserved=0>  is the way to move on from the pandemic.

Trade unions have traditionally played a vital role in defending our communities from hate speech and actions, and in campaigning for fairness and equality. This workshop utilises materials developed by the TUC and anti-racism organisations to help build your confidence in challenging far-right ideas, and helps you tackle difficult conversations, as well as giving practical campaigning tips.
 
Please note once PCS has selected you to attend this course you will be required to complete a CONEL college application form to enrol with the college. This form requires a valid document number for residency in the UK, either a UK passport/Birth Certificate or Visa number

"PCS Pay campaign - Things you can do [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good morning everyone,

 

Apologies for the separate email, but following our payday rally last Friday, there are two actions you can take to support the PCS pay campaign ahead of the budget announcement. But as the announcement is on Wednesday, I couldn’t hold off until the newsletter. I hope you don’t mind.

 

*	TUC pre-budget rally: On 2 March the TUC and Labour’s Anneliese Dodds will be presenting a ‘Workers’ Budget’ as an alternative to the Government’s Budget on 3 March. The Workers’ Budget will focus on decent sick pay for all, pay rise for key workers and safe workplaces. The link to sign up is here: Rally for a Workers’ Budget | TUC <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuc.org.uk%2Frally-workers-budget&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb0a3b13cac6b4ea0087908d8dcc8abc2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637502101731036133%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=GjJpK0pUTG6aK4WuV0kVIf3BRxEG8T7YngjkslifQZM%3D&reserved=0> . Other speakers will be the TUC’s Frances O’Grady and our very own general secretary Mark Serwotka.
*	PCS e-action: We’ve launched an e-action to ask the Chancellor to scrap the pay freeze from the budget. We want as many members as possible to email the chancellor ahead of Wednesday, so please circulate widely. The link to the e-action can be found on this page here: Email Sunak to tell him scrap the pay freeze | Public and Commercial Services Union (pcs.org.uk) <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcs.org.uk%2Fnews%2Femail-sunak-to-tell-him-scrap-the-pay-freeze&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb0a3b13cac6b4ea0087908d8dcc8abc2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637502101731046128%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=qZKcznFhETBQ0E1xLYqEpvZ7hVuDlxVXkwTENR0do7U%3D&reserved=0> . A prewritten email is available, but feel free to edit it to suit your own style, as long as you keep it civilised.

Branch News 	
Annual General Meeting (AGM) readout
Last week we had our Annual General Meeting for 2021. We had almost 40 members there, which was a great turnout. Hopefully when we do it again next year we can do something social after ?? 

Main takeaways from the AGM:

*	We confirmed our new branch executive committee, and you can find the new composition on the Wire here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D6e6b755f45%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C1bc8cb0338c348d33f7708d8df1f0e2b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637504671813249880%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=44th%2Fqp5CqX95eU4FVV%2FWcGbmb0dmH%2FURK4YqtNcqXg%3D&reserved=0> .
*	We agreed to create a network of reps for each directorate and portfolio in Ofgem. If you’re interested in becoming the representative for your directorate or team, get in touch with Frank. As we’re just setting this up this year, we plan to confirm reps on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis.
*	We also agreed to put a motion to our national conference, which is later this year, to affiliate PCS to the 4 Day Week Campaign.
*	There was a lot of debate on whether to change our ‘open door’ policy for personal support (on the Wire here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0eea7f7707%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C1bc8cb0338c348d33f7708d8df1f0e2b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637504671813249880%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=YleN5khrToGhKjjXENl%2BPQ7uxu7rggNn7WfBW8OveC0%3D&reserved=0> ). The AGM was just as split as the BEC, so instead of making a decision at the AGM, we will now consult the whole branch. So watch this space!

	
Update on the Real Living Wage Petition
As some of you know, we believe that Ofgem ought to ensure that all our colleagues are paid enough to at least cover the cost of living, especially in these uncertain times.

Reminder: Update your directorate and team
An important part of union organising is knowing where your members are, so we can focus our activity and recruitment. But all these pesky restructures at Ofgem make that quite difficult, and some of our details are now quite out of date! If you haven’t already done so, please use our survey to update your details

E-action to scrap the pay freeze
Our members are particularly concerned about the effect that a further pay freeze will have on their living standards as they have been subject to various forms of pay restraint for over 10 years. We call upon the government to scrap the proposed pay freeze on the civil service and ensure the Treasury funds a fair pay rise for our members. We have launched an e-action <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D40cefc12b1%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C1bc8cb0338c348d33f7708d8df1f0e2b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637504671813289855%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=aVV3QW1eqlW574kkaVZDEnmIpNnIggcrdP8FpTgNXdA%3D&reserved=0>  so our members and supporters can email Sunak to show support towards scrapping the freeze.

Racism & Intolerance: Changing Attitudes in the Workplace Workshop
Trade unions have traditionally played a vital role in defending our communities from hate speech and actions, and in campaigning for fairness and equality.

Women's History Month 2021 A Better Future For Women
Members can register for this year’s TUC Women’s Conference <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D328010b908%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C1bc8cb0338c348d33f7708d8df1f0e2b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637504671813309838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=dyuo0MC5VOKCEC6Lw%2F2tWpSpN3IN99FdjNiX96ATsDw%3D&reserved=0>  on 3-5 March. The conference is online for the first time; you do not have to attend for the full three days. It is an opportunity to hear speakers on a variety of topics, sign up for various sessions and, hopefully, feel able to take that step to becoming more involved in union activity and supporting and uplifting other women.
To round off Women’s History Month, there will be a PCS event on Zoom on 30 March, from 6.30 – 7.45 pm, entitled Celebrating Women, Past, Present and Future. More details to follow. This event will be chaired by Zita Holbourne, PCS national vice president.

"Where is my PCS newsletter? [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good morning everyone,

 

You may have been wondering where your weekly PCS newsletter has been this past couple of weeks. Unfortunately, turns out that Ofgem’s junk mail filter doesn’t like it. We’ve asked IT to look into it, but in the meantime, recommend that you have a look in your junk mail and tell your Outlook that the newsletter is, obviously ??, not junk.

"PCS Social Drop-in","Dear members,

 

On 17 March it has been a year since we started working from home. It has been a long year, and clearly we aren’t out of the woods yet. While not an anniversary we want to celebrate, we did think this was a good moment to bring back the PCS drop ins we had during the early phase of lockdown. Some of you will remember that we set up recurring meetings just for people to have a chat and stay in touch with each other. A year on, there’s probably still value to this, maybe even more than before. So in true Marvel style, we’re going for a reboot. 

 

To make things a bit more interesting, someone from the branch executive committee will be along to give an update on what we’ve been up to, and answer any questions. For this event, we’ll likely cover the annual general meeting and our latest meeting with Ofgem. But we’ll be happy to answer any other questions you might have as well, though remember this is not a suitable forum for any personal matters. 

 

Other than that, this is an opportunity to (re)connect with your fellow members and have some social chat. There may even be games, or another impromptu quiz, who knows! ??

 

Hope to see you there,

 

Frank

LI - Substation groups : these values have 2 consecutive spaces in them (Check for repeated use)

LI  maximum demand as % of LI firm capacity

 

Is a reinforcement to increase firm capacity for this demand group  planned over ED2?

"PCS Pay Day rally","Dear Member,

 

We are continuing our series of pay day rallies as part of our campaign for fair pay <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcs.org.uk%2Fcampaigns%2Fsupport-the-pcs-national-campaign%2Frestore-fair-and-equal-pay-for-all&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Ce207bdc22ca94ccae8af08d8e85eb0c2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637514840725666319%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=7SauDQ2rgsDyTrkNiyz%2ByBfatrZWRH0dHMD81KU8kH8%3D&reserved=0> , and against the public sector pay freeze. That is why on 31 March, we are holding a joint event with other unions who are also fighting for fair pay. You can hear experiences from a healthcare worker, British Gas employee and shop worker, alongside one of our own members. This event is part of our push for a joint union campaign for pay at the Trade Union Congress (TUC). But while co-ordinating at the TUC is important, what is really vital is building alliances at regional and local level between workers from across all unions. 

 

So come along to show your support for our pay campaign, hear experiences from workers from other sectors, and find out what our next steps are. Our pay day rally on 31 January had over 100 activists and members at it, but we are looking to do even better this time round!

"PCS Pay Day rally - Glasgow","Dear Glasgow members, 

The recent announcement of a further pay freeze for civil servants has come as a slap in the face after over a decade of continued pay restraint in the sector. The PCS campaign to pressure the government continues, and it’s important that we keep the momentum and energy going!

Not only do Civil Servants deserve a fair pay rise, but further pay austerity makes no economic sense. Putting money in the pockets of public sector workers, who will spend that money in the private sector economy, will help the country recover economically post-Covid. 

In Glasgow, the Town Committee are holding an event on pay day Wednesday 31st of March from 1pm – 2pm with PCS National President Fran Heathcote and Chair of the PCS Parliamentary Group and Local MP, Chris Stephens. We encourage all of you to come along to bolster our campaign, to hear from Fran about the next steps for the campaign, and hear from Chris how the PCS Parliamentary Group is making the case for fair pay in Parliament.

This event clashes with the other invite we sent round earlier, which is the London & South East event. That’s the advantage of having a branch with two offices, you get to pick which rally you like most ?? But that does mean you have to choose which rally to attend.

WFH Anniversary

On Wednesday we marked one year since the start of lockdown by rebooting our PCS social drop-ins. Conversation ranged from the difference between craft and industrial unions to the best games for team meetings, and what’s most bingeable on BBC iPlayer right now. If you’re also keen to see some faces other than your usual colleagues, then keep an eye out for the next invite. We plan to experiment a bit with the time, but do also just let us know what you think will or won't work.

In case you haven’t caught up yet with the PCS February Bulletin, have a read of the Wire article <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Da8a64ac834%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Ca19a32e893194312aa3208d8ea21de5b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637516778495110800%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=pYW%2BIlrsgmtODXsidtduCR7GF%2BFCBUPmFLBL0xBE5g4%3D&reserved=0>  and do share with your colleagues.
	
Volunteer to be a Rep for your Directorate!

After the AGM we agreed create a network of reps/champions for each directorate and portfolio in Ofgem. If you’re interested in becoming the representative for your directorate or team, or have any queries then get in touch with Frank Hemmes (frank.hemmes@ofgem.gov.uk). As we’re just setting this up this year, we plan to confirm reps on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis.
	
Reminder: COVID-19 Support Network

HR have announced that they are thinking about setting up a Covid support network. We would like to encourage all members who might be interested to email Alison Davies to express an interest (and if you’re comfortable doing so, copy us in: pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> ).

Privatisation does not work: End privatisation at the Imperial War Museum

For 7 years the IWM has outsourced the visitor & security services which has clearly failed. It does not work for the public, for the workers or for the museum collections.  Workers have endured mismanagement, as well as payroll and pension administration problems and it is not cost effective to privatise this service.

Reminder: Blood donations still taken

As well as sending out messages of solidarity to NHS colleagues, blood donations are still very much needed and it’s a little known fact that donor centres are still open despite Covid restrictions. Do check your local blood centre’s latest advice and make an appointment to give if you are able to – male donors, Black donors and type O- donors are particularly needed.

Saturday 20 March is United Nations Anti-Racism Day

Stand Up to Racism (SUTR) and the TUC are marking the international day of action with online rallies and other events to unite people across the world against racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism and fascism. Institutional and structural racism is still endemic in our society. The murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate number of black deaths as a result of the Covid pandemic has brought the fight against racial inequality back into the spotlight.

"Real Living Wage Campaign - Update [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear member or colleague,

 

We want to give you an update on where we are with the campaign for a Real Living Wage at Ofgem. You are receiving this because you are either a PCS member or have signed our petition (or both). It has been a while since we started the petition and published something on the Wire, so we owed you an update.

 

What has happened so far?

Negotiations with Ofgem are ongoing, but we have not made as much progress as we’d like. While Ofgem has made some positive noises, there have been no concrete steps towards getting all staff on at least the Real Living Wage. This is despite our estimate that the extra cost to Ofgem would only be about £14,000/year. The lack of progress is particularly concerning because once we enter the next financial year, Ofgem will be more severely constrained by the new public sector pay freeze.

 

What are we asking Ofgem to do?

We think it is still possible to get all staff on the Real Living Wage if Ofgem act quickly. There is no obstacle to offering new starters a starting salary at the Real Living Wage level, even if the formal band minimum remains lower. We know this because it has been done before. For those colleagues already with us on less than the Real Living Wage, we have asked Ofgem to use the advancement process to raise their salary to at least that level.

 

We have twice written to Jonathan Brearley directly to make sure this issue is given the attention it deserves, and to stress that we think that paying the Real Living Wage is essential if Ofgem wants to be ‘the best regulator in the world to work for’. We have attached both letters to this email so you get to see what we have done on the basis of your signatures. We will keep you updated when we hear back again from Ofgem.

 

PCS member, but not signed yet? If you are one of our members but haven’t signed yet, don’t worry, you can still do so here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSdmkoixSK0WUk2pQRsuzZJIggC3dL8Xj-LyCN9Twt9tstxPtQ%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cf7dbcfa8f5664d177af108d8ed5d3774%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637520334174404732%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=dhs8J7edrSRm%2FKC%2FdIXB4gPV%2Bt5YV234T9bvUJWipjg%3D&reserved=0> .

Signed the petition, but not yet a member? Great that you have signed our petition!

Ofgem cancels gym subsidy with no consultation

Ofgem have announced today that they are stopping the gym subsidy arrangements that many staff enjoyed. This decision has been taken outwith the ongoing review of pay and benefits and without any consultation with the Union. We’ve already had a number of staff getting in touch about this, and we will raise this issue with HR. We’d also recommend that staff who are affected by the announcement message HR directly about this decision, copying in Stephanie Broadribb, Interim Director for Corporate Services.

Victory for Shrewsbury 24 as Court of Appeal clears convictions

The Court of Appeal has overturned the convictions of 14 men sentenced for their involvement in pickets in 1972.

In June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites. Trade unionists who picketed during the national builders' strike were then charged with offences including unlawful assembly and conspiracy to intimidate. Lawyers for the so-called Shrewsbury 24 had argued the destruction of witness statements made their convictions unsafe.

PCS statement on the policing bill

The right to free speech and peaceful protest is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy. Yet, a government which says it stands for freedom and democracy proposes giving the police and the home secretary unprecedented powers to criminalise people standing up for social justice. The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, if it becomes law, will give senior police officers and politicians major new powers to restrict the democratic right to protest and to curtail freedom of expression. It will give members of PCS and other trade unions cause for concern.

Branch News 	
Results of PCS survey on Ofgem’s working from home plans
Shortly after Ofgem's announcement that working from home become the 'new normal', PCS ran a survey open to everyone to get feedback on Ofgem's plans. We received 213 responses from both members and non-members. We think this demonstrates the strong desire of staff to give input on the plans, which also come through in the finding that only 28% of respondents thought Ofgem consulted adequately before making the decision.
We have shared detailed results with Ofgem, but we believe everyone is entitled to get the main findings. Unfortunately our slot on Future of Work Show & Tell last week was cancelled, so instead we're sharing our findings here.

Help former member Merlijn: donate to the Riders Roovolt strike fund
Deliveroo’s imminent stock market flotation stands to make its CEO £500 million overnight. But the riders doing the real work earn less than the minimum wage, are at the whim of Deliveroo’s algorithm, and don’t get sick pay. Deliveroo’s working conditions have been well documented in this excellent piece <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2f02d86224%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd8d26c2950534f3374dc08d8f5198849%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637528837314435840%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2FYSzUZjyJJy6%2FVuQwx6Nix43uXRfcStCWf94upsTWXo%3D&reserved=0>  by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism.
Former member Merlijn Kersten who left Ofgem and now works for Deliveroo is asking for our help to bolster the strike hardship fund for the IWGB’s ‘Riders Roovolt’ campaign. Donating to the strike fund means riders can stand up for their rights and demand better working conditions and pay.
Many of us have likely used Deliveroo while stuck at home, so why not make a donation next time you think of ordering takeaway?

Support fellow PCS members at the DVLA
PCS members at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency’s Swansea office will be taking strike action from 6 to 9 April to force management to better protect workers from Covid. At the moment, workers are still required to come into the office, leading to 600 Covid cases on a staff of 6,000. The site was officially designated an outbreak zone in December after a spate of new infections.
Workers don’t get paid when on strike, so to help them avoid financial hardship while taking action, PCS members get paid from our strike fund. PCS has a general strike fund, but individual contributions can either be used to top up standard strike pay, or reduce the claim on the overall fund.
We are again doing a branch-wide collection, and you can make a donation here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D6de3e4c561%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd8d26c2950534f3374dc08d8f5198849%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637528837314445837%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=iKLXVJw0KUE9S3jHMC7XC%2BcsQ%2FLJByu%2B5VIsVUEq8Tg%3D&reserved=0> .

Secure the Workers’ Stories Project’s legacy
The Workers’ Stories Project is a Scottish project documenting the experiences of ordinary workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. With a year passed since the start of Lockdown 1, WSP is looking to give their collection of workers’ stories a permanent online home, as well as creating a touring exhibition. This will ensure that the perspectives of workers on the pandemic, and how they personally experienced it, will not be forgotten.

"FW: Your 1st of April update from PCS [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good morning everyone!

 

I hope you all had a pleasant Easter bank holiday weekend. I’m forwarding last week’s newsletter because I know that for many of you it is still being intercepted by Ofgem’s spamfilters (boo!). If that is the case, see if you can fix it by going into your junk mail and telling Outlook that PCS isn’t spam. If that doesn’t fix it, you can help us by raising an IT ticket about it. 

 

I want to draw particular attention to the strike fund collections for Deliveroo riders and our own fellow members at the DVLA, who are both taking strike action this week. Any contribution you make will help to offset the loss of income for workers taking industrial action.

 

Cheerio,

Frank

Results of PCS survey on Ofgem’s working from home plans
Shortly after Ofgem's announcement that working from home become the 'new normal', PCS ran a survey open to everyone to get feedback on Ofgem's plans. We received 213 responses from both members and non-members. We think this demonstrates the strong desire of staff to give input on the plans, which also come through in the finding that only 28% of respondents thought Ofgem consulted adequately before making the decision.
We have shared detailed results with Ofgem, but we believe everyone is entitled to get the main findings. Unfortunately our slot on Future of Work Show & Tell last week was cancelled, so instead we're sharing our findings here.

Help former member Merlijn: donate to the Riders Roovolt strike fund
Deliveroo’s imminent stock market flotation stands to make its CEO £500 million overnight. But the riders doing the real work earn less than the minimum wage, are at the whim of Deliveroo’s algorithm, and don’t get sick pay. Deliveroo’s working conditions have been well documented in this excellent piece <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2f02d86224%26e%3Dc73198a51c&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C21b08a01fe624e9589bf08d8f8d9cd59%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637532961668288120%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=IxauPtz3M5JeFGJTCZ2QhwVmj9P8pcLHSl0kOVg%2BSXI%3D&reserved=0>  by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism.
Former member Merlijn Kersten who left Ofgem and now works for Deliveroo is asking for our help to bolster the strike hardship fund for the IWGB’s ‘Riders Roovolt’ campaign. Donating to the strike fund means riders can stand up for their rights and demand better working conditions and pay.
Many of us have likely used Deliveroo while stuck at home, so why not make a donation next time you think of ordering takeaway?

Support fellow PCS members at the DVLA
PCS members at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency’s Swansea office will be taking strike action from 6 to 9 April to force management to better protect workers from Covid. At the moment, workers are still required to come into the office, leading to 600 Covid cases on a staff of 6,000. The site was officially designated an outbreak zone in December after a spate of new infections.
Workers don’t get paid when on strike, so to help them avoid financial hardship while taking action, PCS members get paid from our strike fund. PCS has a general strike fund, but individual contributions can either be used to top up standard strike pay, or reduce the claim on the overall fund.
We are again doing a branch-wide collection, and you can make a donation here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D6de3e4c561%26e%3Dc73198a51c&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C21b08a01fe624e9589bf08d8f8d9cd59%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637532961668308086%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2BJ8FccxvuwqTT3%2FxjfJjCT2klHwygXn0xe6J9BspxkI%3D&reserved=0> .

Secure the Workers’ Stories Project’s legacy
The Workers’ Stories Project is a Scottish project documenting the experiences of ordinary workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. With a year passed since the start of Lockdown 1, WSP is looking to give their collection of workers’ stories a permanent online home, as well as creating a touring exhibition. This will ensure that the perspectives of workers on the pandemic, and how they personally experienced it, will not be forgotten.

Glasgow gym subsidy decision under review
 
At the all staff call last week, it was announced the decision to scrap the gym subsidy for staff in Glasgow is now under review. A minded to decision is expected by 19 April.

We wrote an article on the Wire detailing how disappointed members and staff who enjoy the subsidised gym membership were at the sudden decision. We also see this episode as an opportunity for Ofgem to engage in meaningful consultation with PCS and staff moving forward. This is supported by 96% of the 82 respondents to our survey on discounted gym memberships who felt Ofgem should have fully consulted on this change.

The Wire article can be found here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dbeb521f55f%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C42994bb3c87c4f6fa3e208d8fa8fea12%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637534843318638421%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=z7FBty%2BFK4hCOlTaqrWluUQBPGomYWNz76zJKEZPU0U%3D&reserved=0> .
	
PCS Ofgem submits 4 day week motion to conference

Isn’t it great to have these four day weeks? What if every week was like this? Hopefully one day we will get there, and we are doing our bit to make it happen. At our Annual General Meeting we decided to submit a motion to the PCS annual conference that would affiliate the whole union to the 4 Day Week Campaign <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0ee07ec24b%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C42994bb3c87c4f6fa3e208d8fa8fea12%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637534843318638421%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=icfM5OCT14c9yRD8SAgMaYUgiNtqw67nSijc2AQ9LuQ%3D&reserved=0> .

WFH Survey results are out

As Ofgem wasn’t willing to survey staff again about our preferences for continued WFH even post-pandemic, we decided to do it ourselves. Unfortunately our spot at an all staff call fell through at the last minute, but instead we have put our headline results on the Wire (here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D21fd4cb35a%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C42994bb3c87c4f6fa3e208d8fa8fea12%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637534843318643410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=X7B03qV2BtUO38I35ntVZhD7T%2F%2BqX8slUFnlNFaIwDU%3D&reserved=0> ). Generally staff are positive, want maximum flexibility, but Ofgem must also guarantee the right for people to work from the office if for whatever reason they’re not keen or able to WFH. We have shared the detailed results with Ofgem, and expect these to inform the concrete arrangements that will eventually be put in place to manage the new working practices.

Update from the Branch Exec Committee (BEC): The transformation programme
 
This week, we met with Ross McNaughton and the transformation programme team. Per the recent gym debacle, we made it clear that we want to ensure members are consulted on the benefits package review and HR policies review that the transformation programme are undertaking. But what does that actually mean?

We discussed an approach to policy reviews. Imagine a chart with importance on one axis and level of change on the other axis. Any changes the transformation team propose will fit in one of the four quadrants, necessitating different levels of engagement with PCS. We’ve asked for a full categorisation of all policies for review and agreement of clear processes for consultations.

The transformation team have informed us that they are prioritising review of the flexible working policy, bullying and harassment policy, and the change pool policy. We expect to see detail coming through on these, and will keep members abreast.

We’ve also published our monthly update on The Wire. <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Db441dcd71f%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C59f50a7e491c47a1eb7208d9002307bb%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637540972727822081%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=JkL8CfejqLw1jmRxWRy4Tv6PlFZd%2BijObjxlbFo2Y14%3D&reserved=0>  Please encourage your colleagues who are not members of the Union to have a read and learn about the things we have achieved over the last month.

Petition to end race discrimination in the culture sector and reinstate sacked activist Amanda Walker

The PCS union Culture Group is demanding that the culture sector eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and for Historical Royal Palaces to reinstate our Equality rep, Amanda Walker. In 2017, Amanda made history by becoming the first Black female Warden at the Tower of London.

As a PCS union rep in her branch at Historic Royal Palaces, Amanda was deeply involved in the fight to end discrimination and bullying at her workplace Hampton Court Palace. Through her activism she directly challenged patterns of systemic discrimination and favouritism within the palaces which was exposed in the Guardian in March 2021 <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D8a269d9a44%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C59f50a7e491c47a1eb7208d9002307bb%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637540972727842058%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=zZOi6xrqiwJSvXpp%2BiGpXb63njb1%2FENKM9dN9abAIZA%3D&reserved=0> .

Amazon Waged a Brutal Anti-Union Campaign. Unsurprisingly, They Won

There was hard news from Alabama last week, after attempts to unionise Amazon workers failed. Ahead of the ballot, tactics used by management included texting workers  several times a day to urge them to vote no, papering the facility’s bathroom stalls with anti-union flyers, and getting temp staff, ineligible to join the union to wear “vote no” swag.

Made in Bangladesh Film Screening and Q&A
 
If you wear clothes you may be interested to learn the workers making your clothes are not necessarily safe at work. On the 8th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster No Sweat are hosting a screening of “Made In Bangladesh” with a Q&A with the director on the 25th April. (tickets and further info here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dc3b3dd6cbe%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C59f50a7e491c47a1eb7208d9002307bb%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637540972727857017%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=rcBa9witQiAI%2FEAGCwE74fw7PglJ%2FCCkCwTKe9iUsOw%3D&reserved=0> ).

The film is a timely portrayal of a garment worker in Bangladesh fighting for justice. Based on the life of Daliya Akter, a garment worker who escaped child marriage and went on to lead a trade union fighting for workers' rights in the capital Dhaka, this film shows garment workers not as passive victims of the sweatshop system but active participants in the fight for better working conditions and better lives.

Office Risk Assessments
 
Health and Safety is the theme of the week it seems. We were last provided with the office risk assessments for review in September 2020. Our Health and Safety representative has been querying how up to date and robust the office risk assessments are, given that a single document has been drafted to cover all three office sites. Knowing the considerable differences in sites and their management, this continues to be a concern for us. We welcome your thoughts and any experiences you might be able to share from working in the office during lockdown.

There is still time to register for the PCS National conference! This is a brilliant learning opportunity for aspiring activists and a great place to pick up ideas for things we might be able to push for at branch level. Email Laura Hutton to add your name!

PCS members to take further strike action at the DVLA over health and safety.

PCS has today notified the DVLA of its intention to take a further four days of strike action from 4 to 7 May.

This latest period of strike action follows the successful walkout during 6-9 April <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3De1cc07469c%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C961b74be6b8f4f89e03c08d9059eb5d6%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637547003699199174%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Wa%2BPtIWt43Uh9PTVFDs8%2B97wCiZ0Ai3uKBJyFdwOCXg%3D&reserved=0> , where over 1,400 PCS members took strike action over health and safety concerns at the DVLA sites. Over 2000 staff are being made to attend the site daily. PCS will again be asking all staff who are being made to go into work to take the action. This is in a bid to get the DVLA senior leadership to take health and safety concerns seriously and reduce numbers on site.

International Worker's Memorial Day 2021 
Wednesday 28th April 2021
11am-12noon
 
Below is a link to the Eventbrite invitation to this year’s Scotland-wide International Workers Memorial Day online event. The event is jointly organised by the STUC and Scottish Hazards.

Our theme for this year’s IWDM is: Health and Safety is a human right - let’s make it a reality. With speakers from trade unions and the wider health and safety community. Every year more people are killed at work than in wars. Most don't die of mystery ailments, or in tragic ""accidents""; they die because an employer decided their safety just wasn't that important a priority. International Workers’ Memorial Day (IWMD) commemorates those workers.

Sign up here to join the STUC International Workers Memorial Day Commemoration <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2ed3883411%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C961b74be6b8f4f89e03c08d9059eb5d6%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637547003699209168%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=39NjP48slbHd9HOF%2FGySRO0V2hQf6guxuaBaf8Px%2F50%3D&reserved=0> 
	
Made in Bangladesh Film Screening and Q&A: This Sunday
 
If you wear clothes you may be interested to learn the workers making your clothes are not necessarily safe at work. On the 8th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster No Sweat are hosting a screening of “Made In Bangladesh” with a Q&A with the director on the 25th April. (tickets and further info here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Da7548b5eec%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C961b74be6b8f4f89e03c08d9059eb5d6%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637547003699209168%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=lyrbamBjuxAfcGu1%2F%2F0JBm8WKAZBjEjp9BqZzO6osdI%3D&reserved=0> ).

The film is a timely portrayal of a garment worker in Bangladesh fighting for justice. Based on the life of Daliya Akter, a garment worker who escaped child marriage and went on to lead a trade union fighting for workers' rights in the capital Dhaka, this film shows garment workers not as passive victims of the sweatshop system but active participants in the fight for better working conditions and better lives.

Branch News 	
Covid support network

We got a bit bored of waiting for Ofgem to sort this out, so Patrick and Cheral have now decided to move forward with the Covid support network ourselves. The network is for people personally impacted by Covid, either because they contracted it themselves, or their direct friends or family did. The first gathering is on Thursday 13 May 11:30 – 12:30. If you want to come along, contact Patrick or Cheral.
	
COVID Vaccine Sick leave

For all colleagues and managers, if you/your team member experience vaccine side-effects this should be logged as COVID related leave in My HR, if you have any questions about this feel free to contact pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk>  or your union rep.
	
Health & Safety

We are engaging with Ofgem Estates on the risk assessments for the offices, as we are nearing a possible return. We want Ofgem to produce tailored risk assessments for each office, especially in light of the differences in ventilation. We also plan to make contact with the PCS branch at the Health & Safety Executive, who we’re likely to share part of the floor in 10SC with.
	
Reminder: Come to conference!

There is still time to register for the PCS National conference! This is a brilliant learning opportunity for aspiring activists and a great place to pick up ideas for things we might be able to push for at branch level.

39 Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared

Judges have quashed the convictions of 39 former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. They were convicted of stealing money, with some imprisoned, after the Post Office installed the Horizon computer system in branches which was found to be a flawed system. Campaigners including trade unionists fought a long and hard series of legal battles for compensation in the civil courts and you can read on about this here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dca7990c598%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C340bf0617dd14d8f35fb08d90afec9d5%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637552911712072215%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=VSskIDI2JFo7mBe6b2CO2RZ8pdDToum7Uu9ZNgSOiaA%3D&reserved=0> .
	
Have your say in your union

PCS is a democratic, lay-led union. As a member you can decide who represents you, who leads the union and what policies it adopts. You can influence PCS itself by taking part in nominating members who want to stand in elections, and then voting at all levels – from branch and group committees to national structures.

Bye bye Wire, hello censorship

Was it something we said? We’re not sure, but as of yesterday Ofgem has decreed that we are no longer to use the Wire for dastardly deeds of propaganda such as, ehm, celebrating May Day or campaigning for a Real Living Wage. After enquiring why our latest Wire articles had mysteriously vanished, we were told that “in line with other government departments”, our Wire days are now over. Even our back catalogue of articles isn’t safe, and is soon to be purged. Clearly we’re not happy about this and we’ll be making our displeasure known to Ofgem. But in the meantime, we will have to think about alternative means of communication. Not just with you, but also with colleagues who aren’t yet members. We’ve put a little survey together to see what you think might work, so it’d be great if you could click below to complete it:

In the meantime, we have included the April update we had planned to publish below, for your perusal:
We hope you all enjoyed your May Bank Holiday, don’t forget this was brought to you by the labour movement. To see what other things collective action can bring you, have a look at our download for April below: 

*	Transformation Programme: Through our regular meetings with Ofgem, we now engage directly with the Transformation Programme. We will soon be provided with a matrix of priority outputs as part of the TP, and we expect to get early sight of the findings of the McKinsey review that will be shared with staff this month.
*	IWMD: On 28 April we held a minute’s silence as part of International Workers Memorial Day, to commemorate all those who lost their lives at work due to unsafe working conditions.

*	Gym subsidy: We actually didn’t get round to publishing the results of our gym subsidy survey in April. We had put it online and planned to link to it here, but hey, censors gotta censor.
*	DVLA Strike Fund: We contributed £115 to the strike fund of our members in the Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Agency, who are taking action to make their workplace Covid-safe. The DVLA office in Swansea has seen 600 Covid infections, making it one of the worst impacted workplaces in the country.

	
Reminder: Covid support network
We got bored of waiting for Ofgem to sort this out, so Patrick and Cheral have now decided to move forward with the Covid support network. The network is for people personally impacted by Covid, either because they contracted it themselves, or their direct friends or family did. The first gathering is on Thursday 13 May 11:30 – 12:30. If you want to come along, contact Patrick or Cheral.

Treasury trying to steal pension improvements and reduced contributions

Many PCS members will be angry about the possibility that reduced pension contributions of at least 2% and improved benefits could be snatched away at the same time that many of them face a further pay freeze, also imposed by this government. There has been unjustifiable government interference in the pension valuation and cost cap processes in recent years. PCS will be urging members to support our campaign against these outrageous acts in the months ahead read further here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0b0f7ccccf%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cf9de640a39df4e15bb4208d9108b3293%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637559012312443011%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=26DFAjYMJIWJAX7BuMXmYAP6%2F1mSJF30cKQD%2BAATJHY%3D&reserved=0> .
	
NEC support for DVLA branch on strike

Over 3,400 PCS members in the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) are in dispute over health and safety concerns after being forced to work on site during the pandemic. DVLA sites in Swansea have recorded more than 600 Covid cases and a fatality, the largest outbreak of Covid in any UK workplace, with the contact centre being declared an outbreak site by Public Health Wales last December. Last week the National Executive Committee (NEC) met and agreed to give full support to the DVLA Branch taking strike action this week. A donation to the hardship fund of £10,000 was agreed.

Have your say in your union

PCS is a democratic, lay-led union. As a member you can decide who represents you, who leads the union and what policies it adopts. You can influence PCS itself by taking part in nominating members who want to stand in elections, and then voting at all levels – from branch and group committees to national structures.

"Our response to Ofgem's decision to ban us from the Wire [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

I hope you are all enjoying today’s all staff call right now. I’ve just heard that Ofgem is keen to ‘have the conversation’ with staff. We as PCS are of course keen to be part of that conversation, which is why we have been surprised and disappointed at Ofgem’s decision to remove our access to the Wire, and delete some of our recent articles. We already mentioned this in last week’s newsletter, but today we have formally conveyed our concern over this decision to Ofgem, and asked for our Wire access to be reinstated. Our letter to Ofgem is attached.

 

Of course, this is not directed at our colleagues in Comms, and we appreciate the assistance they have given us over the years with getting our message out there for all of Ofgem’s staff.

 

If you have any questions, do get in touch.

"#SpyCops inquiry - How police infiltrated the trade union movement","Dear members,

 

We’re pleased to invite you to another PCS Movie Night! This time we will be looking at the ongoing #spycops inquiry, which is looking at police infiltration of left wing organisations, including trade unions. The inquiry has just finished it’s second phase, and more information can be found here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ucpi.org.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C81919dd2283c4e176e1b08d9149c6c02%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637563484341591597%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=R0L8HuE7bx6fcEsezdaFoO%2FiqQCzN2TgPLMLhWu3mbw%3D&reserved=0> . 

 

Programme for the evening:

*	We will screen a short video with testimony from people personally impacted by police infiltration. We’re still deciding what a good video us, but as usual we will share the link on the day so you can watch it directly on your own device.
*	PCS’s very own Lois Austin, who works for the London & South East regional office as an organiser, will talk about her personal experience with the inquiry. 
*	There will be opportunity for questions at the end.

 

We are hosting this meeting via Zoom for privacy reasons. If your department does not allow Zoom on your work computer, you may be able to access it using your browser. Otherwise, you can forward the link to a personal device.

 

This event is hosted by PCS Ofgem but will be shared with other branches in Canary Wharf and Glasgow.

Branch News 	
Donation to IWGB’s Riders Roovolt strike fund

Following calls in previous newsletters to contribute to a strike fund for Deliveroo riders demanding better pay and working conditions, we are proud to have sent £110. Striking always has a financial cost and especially so for those in low pay, precarious work. This is another example of the collective power of us as a branch. See the tweet of the week above for how these contributions and shows of solidarity are greatly received.  

	
We’re looking for a London-based Health and Safety Rep!
 
The pandemic has forced health and safety further up the agenda after decades of neglect. We are still looking for a London-based Health and Safety Rep. You would be working with a number of other motivated health and safety reps across PCS and Canary Wharf. If you would be interested in helping improve and protect the health and safety of your colleagues, please get in touch with Patrick Gould, our Glasgow-based Health and Safety Rep to find out more!
	
Eid Mubarak to Muslim colleagues

During these very difficult times, we wish a very Happy Eid to all colleagues celebrating. We hope you can enjoy some time with your loved ones safely.

PCS reacts to Queen’s speech

The Queen’s speech was heavy on rhetoric but thin on concrete proposals that can bring the government’s “levelling-up agenda” into being. The much anticipated Employment Bill was a glaring omission and with a 0% pay rise confirmed for civil servants, the failure to recognise the efforts and struggles of working people over the last year in particular is hard to swallow and will require action. You can read PCS statement on the Queen’s speech here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Da8cb601159%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C54b0959a624d4bc8f34e08d9161bee03%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637565131510462110%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=HF3iSkonUonR%2BDU3QB4Wf926NLhwRHv8bDdWCcp9X90%3D&reserved=0> .

PCS Movie Night: #Spycops Inquiry
 
We’re pleased to invite you to another PCS Movie Night! This time we will be looking at the ongoing #spycops inquiry, which is looking at police infiltration of left-wing organisations, including trade unions. The inquiry has just finished its second phase, and more information can be found here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Db66bc86c0f%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C54b0959a624d4bc8f34e08d9161bee03%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637565131510462110%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=YkXFUT9ofxFMM49t6xn8SvWXyzleoSYz5HidDi89%2By8%3D&reserved=0> .

Programme for the evening:

*	We will screen a short video with testimony from people personally impacted by police infiltration. We’re still deciding what a good video to use, but as usual we will share the link on the day so you can watch it directly on your own device.
*	PCS’s very own Lois Austin, who works for the London & South East regional office as an organiser, will talk about her personal experience with the inquiry.
*	There will be opportunity for questions at the end.

We are hosting this meeting via Zoom for privacy reasons. If your department does not allow Zoom on your work computer, you may be able to access it using your browser. Otherwise, you can forward the link to a personal device.

This event is hosted by PCS Ofgem but will be shared with other branches in Canary Wharf and Glasgow.

Branch News 	
Weekly update from the Branch Exec Committee (BEC):

Health and Safety has been high on the agenda this week with the approaching return to offices. Our excellent Health and Safety rep, Patrick Gould, raised the point that the existing office risk assessments are not site specific, and following consultation with HSE, concluded that this does not meet the required measure of “suitable and sufficient”. We’ve raised this with Estates and asked that they update the risk assessments, and are pleased to report that Estates are going to do just that. Thanks, Patrick!
 
	
Reminder: We’re looking for a London-based Health and Safety Rep!
 
The pandemic has forced health and safety further up the agenda after decades of neglect. We are still looking for a London-based Health and Safety Rep. You would be working with a number of other motivated health and safety reps across PCS and Canary Wharf. If you would be interested in helping improve and protect the health and safety of your colleagues, please get in touch with Patrick Gould, our Glasgow-based Health and Safety Rep to find out more!

Over 3,400 PCS members in the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) are in dispute over health and safety concerns after being forced to work on site during the pandemic. DVLA sites in Swansea have recorded more than 600 Covid cases and a fatality, the largest outbreak of Covid in any UK workplace, with the contact centre being declared an outbreak site by Public Health Wales last December. Last week the National Executive Committee (NEC) met and agreed to give full support to the DVLA Branch taking strike action this week. A donation to the hardship fund of £10,000 was agreed.

Programme for the evening:

*	We will screen a short video with testimony from people personally impacted by police infiltration. We’re still deciding what a good video to use, but as usual we will share the link on the day so you can watch it directly on your own device.
*	PCS’s very own Lois Austin, who works for the London & South East regional office as an organiser, will talk about her personal experience with the inquiry.
*	There will be opportunity for questions at the end.

We are hosting this meeting via Zoom for privacy reasons. If your department does not allow Zoom on your work computer, you may be able to access it using your browser. Otherwise, you can forward the link to a personal device.

This event is hosted by PCS Ofgem but will be shared with other branches in Canary Wharf and Glasgow.

"Mandating meeting","Dear members,

 

We’re now into June, the sun is shining, summer is starting and with the vaccine roll-out progressing, we may even be able to enjoy the great outdoors. Alas, Summer is also the season of the grand PCS Conferences, where delegates from all across the union get to set policy and strategy for the next year. Unfortunately for yours truly and Laura, who will be representing you this year, Conference will not take place in sunny Brighton, but instead be a virtual affair. So more Zoom for us.

 

Regardless of means and methods, when we speak and vote at Conference we have to make sure we represent your views. You are therefore invited to our mandating meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the motions proposed to conference, and instruct Laura and myself how to vote. 

 

Intermezzo: How does Conference work?

Conference takes place each year. All branches can propose motions, though not all of them are selected from the agenda*. At conference, branches get a number of votes based on the number of members they have. Ofgem gets 1 vote. 

There are two parts to conference, the National Conference, which is for all branches in PCS, and Group Conferences. Each PCS branch is in a Group. Usually this is done by department, e.g. all HMRC branches will be in the HMRC Group. For us it is a bit different. Ofgem is in the ‘Public Sector Group’, which is essentially the bucket with leftover branches that don’t fit anywhere else. We keep such auspicious company as the Church of England and Health & Safety Executive. 

 

National Conference is on 13 and 14 June, and Frank will be representing us. Group Conference is on 10 June and Laura will represent us.

 

How does the Mandating Meeting work?

The number of motions on the agenda for both conferences is too large to discuss all of them. Therefore, the BEC has reviewed the agendas and has highlighted motions that we think warrant debate. We have also indicated how we intend to vote if we receive no other instructions from members. The agendas for the Group Conference and National Conference are attached. We have also attached our review of the National Conference agenda. Our review of the Group Conference agenda will follow shortly. The National Conference motions we recommend for debate are: A9, A10, A13, A16, A22, A23, A25, A26, A30, A31, A34, A38, A63, A64. However, you can ask for any motion to be discussed at the Mandating Meeting.

We will then work through them at the mandating meeting in descending order. 

 

If you cannot attend the meeting, please email any views to Frank Hemmes.

 

*NB: You will find that unfortunately, our motion to affiliate to the 4 Day Week Campaign was not included on this year’s conference agenda.

 

Cheerio,
Frank

"Update on our Wire ban [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

You will remember that on 11 May we wrote to Ofgem expressing our concern and disappointment in their decision to remove our access to the Wire. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, Ofgem was not moved by our representations and have reiterated their arguments. Arguments which, in our view, have very little merit. We have responded to Ofgem’s latest, but do not expect to make much progress in getting them to change their mind at this time. Ofgem’s correspondence from both HR and Comms in relation to this issue is attached, our latest reply is included below.

 

“Good afternoon Rachel,

 

Thank you for the email in relation to PCS Union’s existing pages on the Wire.  We remain disappointed at Ofgem’s decision to remove our access to the Wire, in particular in light of the significant change programme that Ofgem is about to embark on, and PCS’s role in representing staff interests during this time. With regards to the limited rationale provided, we note that:

 

*	Alignment with other parts of the Civil Service is not in and of itself a reason to change the previous arrangement, given that Ofgem clearly has discretion in this area. We therefore assume that there are other motivating reasons why alignment is, at this point in time, Ofgem’s preferred option.
*	While we acknowledge that the facilities agreement provides for the use of physical notice boards in the office, the facilities agreement predates the Pandemic and the Transformation project. With staff now continuing to work predominantly from home, these boards are clearly of reduced utility. We would argue that with most staff now interacting digitally, the Wire is a de facto staff notice board.

Nonetheless, while we remain unconvinced of the reasoning, we note that senior decision makers in comms do not appear inclined to engage directly with us or to reconsider their position. In the interest of good and open communication and of the existing relationship between Ofgem and PCS Union we would appreciate it if key decision makers would attend a Joint Negotiating Committee to better set out their arguments and to engage in dialogue with us about a decision that clearly has a significant impact on the Union and our ability to function in Ofgem. 

 

Kind Regards

Flo Silver”

 

This means that instead, we need to start thinking about other ways to communicate with you, but importantly, also with our non-member colleagues. So we want to know what you think would be effective alternatives to the Wire. You can help us by letting us know via this Google Form here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSe3yjqSU8R1N184GrbV1ekPVwG98yP-JOkUAnGe6TMhgkzsFw%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C3056af904327416c3f5908d925dff186%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637582466942095746%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=lDXJxBGZ8%2FgaiJWUTWMrIg2oiU0hOXF2mn%2BPAcUg%2F5k%3D&reserved=0> . 

 

This doesn’t mean we won’t try to lift this censorship in the future, but for now we do not have a way to compel Ofgem to do this. However, if you wanted to help, we would encourage you to write to askjonathan@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:askjonathan@ofgem.gov.uk>  and make your concerns known.

Branch News 	
 What’s on with Ofgem 
The next Joint Negotiating Committee meeting (our monthly meet with Ofgem) is soon. We have put a lot on the agenda, including:

*	Pay: We will set out our markers for the pay negotiation based on the Treasury Remit. This includes raising the issue of a Real Living Wage at Ofgem.
*	Return to the Office: We’ll seek an update on Ofgem’s plans and progress on the tech necessary to facilitate office working.
*	Comms: We’ve asked for Comms to explain their reasons for kicking us off the Wire.
*	Risk Assessments: We asked for an update on the office Risk Assessments by Friday 4 June. So we will either discuss them, or their absence, at the JNC.

Reprioritisation of union work 
You will have gathered from the newsletter and our other communications that there is a lot going on right now: pay negotiations, Transformation Programme, PCS Conference, censorship. The BEC is committed to dealing with all of this, but it has unfortunately meant that we have deprioritised some other work that had come out of our Annual General Meeting. So for the moment, we are pausing our work on:

*	Consulting on our approach to new members seeking casework support.
*	Running a campaign on workload and work/life balance.

If you have any concerns about this, do let us know. If you want to help us so we can do and achieve more, come and speak to Laura or Frank.

Ministers scupper DVLA deal
 
PCS members at DVLA thought they had reached a deal with management on enhanced Covid safety in what is one of the worst hit offices in the UK. Yet at the last minute, DVLA management reneged on their promises and took their deal off the table. Which means members at DVLA are back on strike.

Help us prepare for Conference
 
Conference season is now fast approaching with our ‘Group’ conference on the 10 June and the PCS main conference on the 13 and 14 of June. At both conferences we will vote on proposals for union policy and strategy. This isn’t a matter of personal preference of our delegates, but instead we represent you as the branch.

"Mandating meeting","Update: BEC recommendations for both the National and Group conferences are now included (on separate tabs) of the attached spreadsheet.

 

Dear members,

 

We’re now into June, the sun is shining, summer is starting and with the vaccine roll-out progressing, we may even be able to enjoy the great outdoors. Alas, Summer is also the season of the grand PCS Conferences, where delegates from all across the union get to set policy and strategy for the next year. Unfortunately for yours truly and Laura, who will be representing you this year, Conference will not take place in sunny Brighton, but instead be a virtual affair. So more Zoom for us.

 

Regardless of means and methods, when we speak and vote at Conference we have to make sure we represent your views. You are therefore invited to our mandating meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the motions proposed to conference, and instruct Laura and myself how to vote. 

 

Intermezzo: How does Conference work?

Conference takes place each year. All branches can propose motions, though not all of them are selected from the agenda*. At conference, branches get a number of votes based on the number of members they have. Ofgem gets 1 vote. 

There are two parts to conference, the National Conference, which is for all branches in PCS, and Group Conferences. Each PCS branch is in a Group. Usually this is done by department, e.g. all HMRC branches will be in the HMRC Group. For us it is a bit different. Ofgem is in the ‘Public Sector Group’, which is essentially the bucket with leftover branches that don’t fit anywhere else. We keep such auspicious company as the Church of England and Health & Safety Executive. 

 

National Conference is on 13 and 14 June, and Frank will be representing us. Group Conference is on 10 June and Laura will represent us.

 

How does the Mandating Meeting work?

The number of motions on the agenda for both conferences is too large to discuss all of them. Therefore, the BEC has reviewed the agendas and has highlighted motions that we think warrant debate. We have also indicated how we intend to vote if we receive no other instructions from members. The agendas for the Group Conference and National Conference are attached. We have also attached our review of the National Conference  and Group conference agendas to set out how we propose to vote, and which motions we recommend for debate. The National Conference motions we recommend for debate are: A9, A10, A13, A16, A22, A23, A25, A26, A30, A31, A34, A38, A63, A64. The Group Conference motions we recommend for debate are A12, A14, A15 and A19. However, you can ask for any motion to be discussed at the Mandating Meeting.

We will then work through them at the mandating meeting in descending order. 

 

If you cannot attend the meeting, please email any views to Frank Hemmes.

 

*NB: You will find that unfortunately, our motion to affiliate to the 4 Day Week Campaign was not included on this year’s conference agenda.

 

Cheerio,
Frank

"PCS Conferences - How we will vote [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good afternoon everyone,

 

Please find attached the updated voting instructions for both the PCS National and Group conferences. The conference agendas that have the full motion texts are also attached for reference. Thank you everyone who attended the mandating meeting yesterday, we had some really good discussion. 

 

We have decided to live report on the conferences using Yammer. I know it’s not widely used, but unfortunately we haven’t yet worked out a way to use Teams without giving away who all our members are. Yammer has the advantage that Laura and I can post updates and anyone can read them without having to join a channel, or use a non-Ofgem social media platform.

Almost half of child refugees travel without an adult companion and so are at risk of being abused, trafficked, or left to navigate the complex and hostile asylum systems on their own. Safe Passage provides direct support to child refugees, and also campaigns for safer routes for refugees. Lowri from Safe Passage will speak about the work that they do, and its connection to the trade union movement.
*	The Central and West Integration Network <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cwin.org.uk%2Fabout-us%2F&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cee671f79d2434ce8183808d92b2691c0%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637588266965665996%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=kkRBuetP2oHfuleCX6S28Oru6X%2FbBW11gSF9Lx8FhJo%3D&reserved=0>  is a charity in Glasgow and Central Scotland working to help refugees, asylum seekers and migrant workers to connect to local communities and help them gain full and equal access to resources and support. CWIN’s focus is strongly on grassroots organising with local communities to empower and connect people. Firdaus from CWIN will speak about CWIN’s work in Glasgow, and how maybe you can become part of it.

 

This event is hosted by PCS Ofgem via Zoom, but open to other branches in Canary Wharf and Glasgow. If you are a rep or activist in another branch, please advertise this to your members. Access details for the event are as follows:

To support the efforts of CWIN and Safe Passage, we will be collecting via a money pool. All money collected will be donated and split equally between both organisations.

Branch News 	
What’s on with Ofgem 

*	Ofgem have come back to us with their office risk assessments, which we're taking to our next Joint Negotiating Committee with Ofgem.
*	We've had a number of conversations this week about the treatment of working from abroad, including with HR. Our understanding is still the same as when we last asked about it (that there are tax/legal blockers that kick in after about 8 weeks, and some countries you just can't take your work stuff to) but it's implementation by HR should be consistent - the message has been communicated to HR, but we expect what they can do to allow it to be more limited. Keep us informed if you're having trouble.
*	Today (Thursday 10th) and Sunday are our Group and National conferences - Laura and Frank will be dialling in to vote on all manner of things. We'll keep you updated of the most exciting bits over Yammer <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Df518f59631%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb3b1c550751a44053d5908d92c064c69%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637589228271765955%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=tQ1iW43nZLDmZFmIePrzwDDK4d5MsIxMPaYxvYyylUA%3D&reserved=0> .

DVLA action: Donate to Strike Fund

DVLA strike action over Covid safety continues this week (7-12 June) after ministers scuppered a deal last week that could have led to agreement.

PCS Ofgem will be marking World Refugee Day with an event on Monday 21 June with two great speakers from the following organisations: 

*	Safe Passage <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D7154ff81f5%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb3b1c550751a44053d5908d92c064c69%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637589228271805934%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=xkn55RoBuAN7pYGMECq414mbijojtl2THCmhjVNSY6M%3D&reserved=0>  - provides direct support to child refugees, and also campaigns for safer routes for refugees. Lowri from Safe Passage will speak about the work that they do, and its connection to the trade union movement.
*	The Central and West Integration Network <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D653a698a74%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb3b1c550751a44053d5908d92c064c69%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637589228271805934%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=tVyYFWy%2F2MrZCICPfMGwFPY1VGMF69%2F4j%2F28EtDMo4k%3D&reserved=0>  is a charity in Glasgow working to help refugees, asylum seekers and migrant workers to connect to local communities and help them gain full and equal access to resources and support. Firdaus from CWIN will speak about their work in Glasgow, and how maybe you can become part of it.

 
To support the efforts of both charities, we will be collecting via a money pool available here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D4c21131f0c%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb3b1c550751a44053d5908d92c064c69%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637589228271815930%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=3lzBY33Kn%2FJZCAiM724LBXvi2ooXLgaK4KMC2NSuM5I%3D&reserved=0> .

What’s on with Ofgem 

*	This week members of the BEC attended the Joint Negotiating Committee with members from Ofgem HR and reps from the FDA (the other recognised Union active in Ofgem).
*	Much of the discussion focused on PCS’s feedback on the Hybrid working policy that forms part of the transformation project. While we see a lot of positive opportunities for staff in this policy we are concerned around the informal nature of it, and the heavy caveats for line mangers to request staff come into the office at their discretion. After almost a year and a half of remote working we feel that there is limited justification for a line manager to require staff to be in the office where they would prefer to work from home and we have requested that the policy be looked at again to provide a better, more clearly articulated set of expectations for both staff and line managers.
*	We've had a number of conversations this week about the treatment of working from abroad, including with HR. Our understanding is still the same as when we last asked about it (that there are tax/legal blockers that kick in after about 8 weeks, and some countries you just can't take your work stuff to) but it's implementation by HR should be consistent - the message has been communicated to HR, but we expect what they can do to allow it to be more limited. Keep us informed if you're having trouble.
*	As we are (still) censored from wire publication please fill out and pass on the following survey to your teams so we can hear how best to communicate with members and non-members: The Wire is dead. Long live...well, what? <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D62e0d88376%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9d2776a689904419e95f08d931ac91ca%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637595439522620432%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=JMfrsoyTDgLW%2BmD7Yf9vQdVm0uA9BlP48%2B4QfLzwbHA%3D&reserved=0>

DVLA action: Donate to Strike Fund

DVLA strike action over Covid safety continues this week (7-12 June) after ministers scuppered a deal last week that could have led to agreement. Disruption to DVLA customer service continues and whilst backlogs grow some members have been exercising the right to work to rule in refusing to take calls instead of their usual duties.

Stories from Windrush: A Multimedia Celebration
  

The Civil Service Race Forum, in collaboration with the MHCLG BAMENet, BEIS Faith and Minority Network and DfT Black Staff and Allies Network are pleased to present our joint event to celebrate Windrush Day 2021.

The event celebrates the Caribbean men and women who arrived in Britain on 22 June 1948 on the ship Empire Windrush, and other settlers who contributed to the rebuilding of the UK after World War II. Windrush Day was given national importance by the British government in June 2018 to celebrate their contributions to Britain's prosperity and modernity.

This event will bring together colleagues across government to learn more about the history behind Windrush: who were the Windrush generation, why did they come to the UK, and how have they and their descendants contributed to wider UK society? Join us for stories and reflections from the Windrush Foundation <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0e5d20a3ad%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9d2776a689904419e95f08d931ac91ca%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637595439522690394%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=rg%2B2pV%2BF3zwnQwmkR0iXL0sjNMWEa2vIIaz5bRbm3s4%3D&reserved=0> , including a poem and calypso performance by Alexander D Great <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dee0fa95e6b%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9d2776a689904419e95f08d931ac91ca%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637595439522690394%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=PGxmJHrF7vx5zSRzWJr5RsajvB1%2FnvE9QGcUza9Rt4k%3D&reserved=0> .

What’s that McKinsey Malarkey?

Well, we don’t really know either why Ofgem has engaged McKinsey, and so far management has been rather tight-lipped in response to any questions. What we do know though, is that McKinsey comes with rather a reputation… A decent overview of it’s inglorious achievements is available here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D3fd53cb69b%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9d2776a689904419e95f08d931ac91ca%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637595439522700388%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ookbgaBcIarzIuC2onDw5GiaUbhQnmbsywPSgXTyS3U%3D&reserved=0> .
 
From trade unionist to president

It sounds like a fairytale, with someone from humble beginnings becoming (or turning out to be) a prince or princess. Or in this case a president. After an incredibly tight race, Pedro Castillo, a teacher, farmer and active trade unionist, was elected president of Peru <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dab99ba63cf%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9d2776a689904419e95f08d931ac91ca%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637595439522700388%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=oxYUnzP7rvX%2FJMffkxO9IRw7tuypl4JjiQnz3wGiVXk%3D&reserved=0> . On such a tight margin he definitely has his work cut out for him, but it does show that for anyone of us, these first steps on the path of trade unionism could lead to greatness! ??

As of 22nd June 2021, PCS has issued a formal notice to OCS confirming that a trade dispute exists between our union and OCS.

Organizing for Power
As seen in our TOTW our Equalities Officer Cheral had the utmost privilege at attending the Organizing4power course over the last 6 weeks. Patrick our H&S rep also joined, and we got to hear about organisations worldwide about their current campaigns: from our very own NHS nurses, to hearing from Albanian comrades who are hoping to set up their only current trade union! The course reaffirmed all workers are the union and we are inspired to keep holding Ofgem accountable and ensure everyone has dignity at work.

Fighting for positive mental health in the workplace – sign up for PCS training
Stress, depression, or anxiety are now the greatest cause of work absence in the UK. Trade unions have a key role to play in ensuring employers provide healthy workplaces.

In 2018, it was revealed that 26% of all sickness absence in the civil service was due to mental health conditions. Our PCS Mental Health in the Workplace training course can give you the knowledge and confidence to help members to challenge where policies may be being breached or employers are unaware of employment rights, and to campaign for good mental health in the workplace.

To register and to find more details on the courses, please see here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3De3cf1e8443%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cbe81be4911954359071d08d93711155f%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637601368789500820%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=YAwRdmBk8mTEFK1mi4rOjvtqfIE%2F4HEoIG8%2BjlHODrY%3D&reserved=0> 
 
	
Supporting the People's Assembly demo this Saturday
PCS supports the People’s Assembly rally in London on 26 June 2021 and encourages our London-based members to support it if you can do so safely and within Covid regulations.

This demonstration resonates with PCS members who have suffered years of pay freezes and cuts, along with attacks on pension rights.
PCS will have a presence on the day and anyone who wants to join us can contact campaigns@pcs.org.uk <mailto:campaigns@pcs.org.uk>  in advance to find the PCS meeting point. We wish to stress again that members should only attend if you feel safe to do so.

"Restructure: PCS member’s priorities (request for input) [OFFICIAL ]","Dear PCS member,

 

By now you will all have had the opportunity to see the briefing on the transformation project’s restructure consultation. For reference, the documents are on the intranet here <http://ofgemintranet/StrategyAndActivities/OD/Pages/DocumentsAndResources.aspx> . We think you’ll agree that it’s significant, and we want to make sure we engage and represent members as best we can. To that end, we’ve set of the details below of what we have already done; our membership engagement strategy over the consultation period; and how you can best share your views. As a PCS member, you have an effective voice and the branch committee will represent your views directly to Jonathan and HR.

 

What we’ve already done

We were briefed on the restructure last week, and have provided written commentary and feedback to JB and HR ahead of the consultation. We made clear where we expect there to be significant membership concern, requested numerous clarification, and set our expectation to continue to feed-in PCS views throughout the consultation. HR have offered us multiple direct meetings throughout the consultation period, including directly with Jonathan, in order for us to represent our memberships views.

 

Our proposed membership engagement strategy

There’s a lot to take in and share your views on. PCS have broken down the proposed changes into a series of themes. We want you to tell us which themes are most important to you, and we’ll run workshops on these to discuss the proposals and gather feedback which we’ll then write up and send on a rolling basis to HR throughout the consultation period. This means that we can cover more information; share views and influence early in the process; and give you the opportunity to comment on the themes that are most important to you. 

 

At each of the workshops, we’ll provide some opening views from our engagement with Ofgem so far and any updates and clarifications from HR, but will primarily seek your views and input.

 

At the end of the consultation period, we’ll compile all feedback into a final consultation response on behalf of the membership.

 

Possible themes are:

 

*	Consultation process – including the time HR are taking to review the consultation responses; the way Ofgem are deciding on the outcomes of the consultation; and the transparency of the consultation.
*	Flexible resourcing – including the model for deployments around Ofgem; the management processes to deliver flexible resourcing; and what happens if you don’t want to change deployment
*	Implementation process – including the processes for voluntary exit; job evaluation against the new grade scales; the selection process for new posts; and what happens to colleagues on fixed term or agency contracts
*	Organisational structure/Career model – including the new hierarchy; the expert track and the management track; professions; how line management works; and how decisions are signed off
*	Pay – including in-band pay progression and the reduction in the number of colleagues eligible for bonuses
*	Performance management – including the appraisal framework and performance reviews
*	Rationale for the re-org – including why the re-org is being done; and whether cultural change will flow from it
*	Recruitment – including how recruitment will work with the new organisational structure
*	Other – please suggest any other themes

 

 

Please vote for the themes that you want to talk about using the ‘like’ function on the Easy Retro board here: EasyRetro - PCS Workshops <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feasyretro.io%2Fpublicboard%2F4nB2DME6UhWWGwuLJHLGDua5i592%2Ff9ba8e07-e05e-4e85-8c21-784d4625e831&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C791567f34522496f67e108d93c7c003c%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637607325543024374%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=z8N%2FEyER%2BTftzRiRsWj3YT7Fmfjvvbo9xlhn%2Fao%2BMq0%3D&reserved=0>  Please and add any further themes you think are important. Please do this by the end of this week so that we can decide which themes to run workshops on/condense multiple themes to one workshop etc. and send workshop invites next week. 

 

The Easy Retro board has space for comments - please use this for comments on the workshop content rather than your overall views, since we have a separate board for wider feedback (see below).

 

Other ways you can feed-in views

We’ll try to run as many workshops as needed, but there are other ways of giving us feedback to share with HR:

 

*	We have a second Easy Retro board for you to post comments, feedback and views on. We’ll be checking this out regularly, and will use it to help guide some of the workshop discussions.

*	Email us: pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> . Please set out any comments under the above themes.
*	Talk to someone on the Branch Exec Committee – we’re listed on the intranet here: http://ofgemintranet/SpecialismsAndGroups/Groups/Unions/Pages/PCS.aspx
*	Talk to a PCS rep in your department. Not sure who your local department rep is? Contact Frank.Hemmes@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:Frank.Hemmes@ofgem.gov.uk>  and he’ll let you know.

We continue to engage with Ofgem on the restructure proposals, based on your input. We encourage everyone to attend Ofgem’s own feedback sessions, and will also continue to organise our own. Our next session is on Tuesday 13 July and will focus on the proposals for pay.
Our priority at the moment is to get more information out there to help you understand and assess the proposals. It’s becoming really clear that your questions aren’t being answered in either the slides or the all staff meetinsg, so we will press Ofgem to do better.

Restructure hot or not
(We’ll use this feature to very briefly highlight what we think are the pros and cons of the proposals, based on our engagement with Ofgem, your feedback, and PCS’s wider policies).Please see the Consultation document here, <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D37da2f8002%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C92289f8d63ba4a3233be08d942200d77%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637613527702930292%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=jvqBWgZbHd3LXB7WpdQjQvlhKJAsMvEzusBZS5dnjxo%3D&reserved=0>  and the FAQ’s provided by Ofgem here. <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D6abed8002f%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C92289f8d63ba4a3233be08d942200d77%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637613527702930292%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Schl1Gqg%2B2jZllKXR5PnqlOOgvuHWP6e9NEBUMkPbHk%3D&reserved=0>  

*	Hot: Targeted L&D to boost your professional and career development.
*	Not: Performance pay restricted to only 20% of staff and a return to the forced distributions.

Rep's Needed 	
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to enure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we need volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by Contacting Frank Hemmes.
Branch News 	
As you might expect, the restructure is consuming most of the BEC’s attention. But we’re keeping our eyes on the other balls out there as well, including: 

*	Risk assessments: We’ve received updated risk assessments from Ofgem as part of the return to the offices. We still think they can be better, with more attention on location-specific risks, and clearer ownership and accountability for the mitigating actions.
*	Wire access: In response to a formal letter from our Full-time Officer (a PCS employee who we can call on to help out our branch in times of need), Ofgem has now said we will retain Wire access and be allowed to post articles, provided we pass them by Comms first to ensure consistency with Ofgem’s comms policies. We have asked Ofgem to set out the exact process to us, so that we can get back to getting our news out there with a minimum of hassle and intervention. Thank you everyone who expressed concerns to Ofgem about this, this has certainly helped to achieve this.

DVLA strikes continue
Action at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) continues as management still refuses to bring back the negotiated deal to make the office more Covid-secure, which was removed at the last minute.

Fighting for equality at the Royal Parks
PCS members employed by Just Ask Estates Service Ltd are being balloted for industrial action as part of their campaign for equal pay and conditions with their Royal Park employed colleagues. The main driving factor would be the issue of the outsourcing of workforces leaving a two-teir structure which leaves inconsistencies in Private and Public sectors causing discrimination and lack of advancement opportunities for those employed by Just Ask Estates. You can read more on this issue here. <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dfc22498f8d%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C92289f8d63ba4a3233be08d942200d77%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637613527702950279%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Yt2TuYfVnd4Z%2F4fRN4%2FC6jKwnQhRKgpVHyohjLvj3b8%3D&reserved=0>

"PCS - Session 4 on OD: SCS/Band E/Band D impacts","Good afternoon everyone,

 

This invite is for the fourth PCS session we are running to gather views on the Organisational Design programme. This session is aimed specifically at those in SCS, Band E or Band D roles who are impacted by the proposal to replace existing leadership grades with the new Portfolio, Workstream and Team Manager roles. 

 

We have sent this invite to all members as we cannot 100% accurately determine who is and isn’t impacted, and we also don’t want to exclude any other members who may have views on this issue. Still, the focus will be on the proposals that impact SCS, Band Es and Band Ds in leadership/management roles. Other parts of the restructure are covered in our other sessions, so keep a lookout for invites for those. We will in all likelihood also schedule a session specifically for Band Ds, so the invite for that should follow shortly.

 

If you cannot attend, do feel free to send your thoughts via email to pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> .

 

Cheerio,

"PCS Event - 4 Day Week Campaign","Dear members and other comrades,

 

I’m pleased to invite you to the next instalment in our series of PCS  Ofgem events. Our upcoming event will discuss the benefits of moving towards a 4 day week as a society, including the impacts on the environment, mental health and productivity. Joe Ryle from the 4 Day Week Campaign <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.4dayweek.co.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd0a358980cbe45de80a708d9461439c4%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637617874952419269%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=iV72QGM32TfmXlXfQuIKBWHDgavOVHZ2xpB4zVCm45c%3D&reserved=0>  will speak to us about the work the campaign does, the arguments for a 4 day week, and recent successful trials (such as this one <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-57724779&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd0a358980cbe45de80a708d9461439c4%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637617874952419269%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ptjgarv1UxfEtPfdYmhtsme6Kjxm8Q0P4UE0KTn7XoQ%3D&reserved=0>  in Iceland). There will then also be opportunity to ask questions. 

 

Ahead of the event, we also want to ask you to consider the following: “What would you do if you had to work one fewer day per week?”.

 

This event is hosted via Zoom, details are below:

This invite is for the fourth PCS session we are running to gather views on the Organisational Design programme. This session is aimed specifically at those in SCS, Band E or Band D roles who are impacted by the proposal to replace existing leadership grades with the new Portfolio, Workstream and Team Manager roles. 

 

We have sent this invite to all members as we cannot 100% accurately determine who is and isn’t impacted, and we also don’t want to exclude any other members who may have views on this issue. Still, the focus will be on the proposals that impact SCS, Band Es and Band Ds in leadership/management roles. Other parts of the restructure are covered in our other sessions, so keep a lookout for invites for those. We will in all likelihood also schedule a session specifically for Band Ds, so the invite for that should follow shortly.

 

If you cannot attend, do feel free to send your thoughts via email to pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> .

 

Cheerio,
Frank

Branch News 	

Restructure News

We continue to engage with Ofgem on the restructure proposals, based on your input. We encourage everyone to attend Ofgem’s own feedback sessions, and will also continue to organise our own. Our next session is on Wednesday 21 July and will focus on the proposals for flex resourcing and organisational structure.
We also have a session on Friday 23 July to focus on the role changes affecting SCS1/Band E and some Band Ds, but is of course open for other members to attend.
Our priority at the moment is to get more information out there to help you understand and assess the proposals. It’s becoming really clear that your questions aren’t being answered in either the slides or the all staff meetings, so we will continue to press Ofgem to do better. We hope to have answers to the consolidated Pay and Progression questions in next week’s newsletter.
Restructure hot or not
(We’ll use this feature to very briefly highlight what we think are the pros and cons of the proposals, based on our engagement with Ofgem, your feedback, and PCS’s wider policies).

Rep’s Needed 
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to enure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we need volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by Contacting Frank Hemmes.
 
	
Branch News
As you might expect, the restructure is consuming most of the BEC’s attention. But we’re keeping our eyes on the other balls out there as well, including: 

*	Risk assessments: We’ve received updated risk assessments from Ofgem as part of the return to the offices. We still think they can be better, with more attention on location-specific risks, and clearer ownership and accountability for the mitigating actions.
*	Wire access: In an interesting turn of events this very morning (Thursday 15 July) Ofgem has once again doubled back on their promise to restore our Wire access: in short, we are permitted to advertise our existence and our meetings alone. We are investigating potentially setting up a website, but we would just like to remind you of Jonathan’s response to this point in a recent all staff call:

‘All that has changed is that, as part of a general tightening up of publishing rights and procedures on our intranet, content from the PCS now needs to be submitted to the internal communications team for it to publish - rather than being directly published by the PCS itself.’ Make of that what you will.

Hands Off British Council campaign
PCS has launched a #HandsOffBritishCouncil campaign against the slash and burn cuts announced at the end of June.
British Council workers feel betrayed after suffering the uncertainty of 2020 and a pay freeze which has meant they have not received any cost of living increase since 2019. They now face compulsory redundancies following the announcement of over 2000 job cuts across the globe.

PCS condemns end of Covid restrictions and sets out safety demands

Given the rising numbers of cases caused by the Delta variant of the various and because the vaccination programme is incomplete we believe it is premature to end restrictions.

"PCS - Stocktake of the OD consultation so far [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

As we are now well into the Organisational Design (OD) consultation period, and we have had opportunity to digest the proposals and fire our first rounds of questions back at Ofgem, we as PCS want to do a general stocktake to gauge your views about the OD as it stands now. We set up a survey via Google Forms here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLScZ51m6LK91j3jWSsm40ozfYKq6DAE186ojZBzSM4k3YoXjfw%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C5b7784559e4b4829ea6b08d94df34235%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637626529460467984%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=qIIuDVfdTkmJXHA2YfTO6w0PlFBc%2FRbp%2BkHwgFDjfQE%3D&reserved=0>  to collect your views. This complements our topic-specific sessions, which we will continue to run. We plan to then consolidate all the feedback we have had in the first four weeks of the consultation period and share this back with you, as we go into the second month of the consultation. 

 

The questions in the survey are general, covering how you feel about the consultation right now, if your understanding has improved or not over the past few weeks, and what you see as the main opportunities and concerns in the proposals so far. This survey isn’t exclusive to PCS members, so you can share this with your colleagues.*

Restructure News

We continue to engage with Ofgem on the restructure proposals, based on your input. We encourage everyone to attend Ofgem’s own feedback sessions, and will also continue to organise our own. Our next session is on Friday 23 July to focus on the role changes affecting SCS1/Band E and some Band Ds, but is of course open for other members to attend.

Our priority at the moment is to get more information out there to help you understand and assess the proposals. It’s becoming really clear that your questions aren’t being answered in either the slides or the all staff meetings, so we will continue to press Ofgem to do better. We hope to have answers to the consolidated Pay and Progression questions in next week’s newsletter. 

We are also running a mid-consultation survey <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D9a0b3ca0fc%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C67f00c7b4bd4479ac05208d9500f6b15%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637628849424993148%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=qhuuT5Xog9tR2yk6DgjdZ4lWHb53XbMaaeV78tsJTns%3D&reserved=0>  for members and non-members to collect your views covering how you feel about the consultation right now, if your understanding has improved or not over the past few weeks, and what you see as the main opportunities and concerns in the proposals so far. This survey isn’t exclusive to PCS members, so you can share this with your colleagues.

Restructure hot or not
(We’ll use this feature to very briefly highlight what we think are the pros and cons of the proposals, based on our engagement with Ofgem, your feedback, and PCS’s wider policies) 

*	Hot: Progressing through a grade based on your skills and experience
*	Not: Being slotted into a grade based on your pay, instead of your skills and experience.


 
	
Rep’s Needed 
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to enure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we need volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by contacting Frank Hemmes.
 
	
Branch News
As you might expect, the restructure is consuming most of the BEC’s attention. But we’re keeping our eyes on the other balls out there as well, including: 

*	Risk assessments: We’ve received updated risk assessments from Ofgem as part of the return to the offices. We still think they can be better, with more attention on location-specific risks, and clearer ownership and accountability for the mitigating actions.
*	Real Living Wage: Whilst the initial promises by Ofgem seem encouraging regarding their commitment to paying the Real Living Wage to all staff we will keep pressing for this to be actioned. The proposed reorganisation pay bands do not currently pay the Real Living Wage so until this is confirmed do continue to sign and share our petition <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D4a0c0c9bf1%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C67f00c7b4bd4479ac05208d9500f6b15%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637628849425013146%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=f7maUK82ir8LZncC2sM2tO4NBe%2BK1ge6vr0KJvU5cr8%3D&reserved=0> .

PCS condemns end of Covid restrictions and sets out safety demands

Hello All, 

 

Many of you have come to our workshops, emailed us or engaged with us in other ways. 

 

We’ve been trying our best to get answers to the questions you have raised and we want to take some time to go through what we do have since we have reached the roughly half way mark in this “consultation”. 

 

Topics to be covered include Pay and Benefits, Flexible resourcing and overall organisational design. 

 

I can’t promise to have all the answers, I can not perform miracles, but we will try and tell you what we know and hopefully it will be helpful. 

 

Many thanks

Flo

	Brilliant article! (cw: some slurs) - in South Asian Heritage Month I have been reflecting how proud I am of the culture I came from, and the strong will of the expats (??) who moved to the UK and never gave up the fight for justice.

Restructure News

We continue to engage with Ofgem on the restructure proposals, based on your input. At the moment our focus remains getting more clarity, because your main feedback is that the proposals are still unclear and you’re unsure how they will actually work out for you. We shared a list of specific questions with Ofgem this week and expect answers by Friday. Those who attend Thursday’s feedback session have had a sneak preview of some of the answers.

We are also formulating a list of concrete recommendations for changes to the proposals, which we will communicate to Ofgem via formal letter. We will share this with you shortly, and encourage you to circulate this within your teams to help your colleagues see what PCS is doing. Our survey is also still live (here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2b91a6b902%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C374e6c6dc21e402916cc08d952a27b9a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637631680080786245%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=18ruvSzOsscYBuHysT3rVhT2%2FO8x%2FrQ7qGrhKFSaex4%3D&reserved=0> ). If you haven’t done so already, please respond to it. The survey can be circulated to your colleagues. Findings so far are: 

*	Over half of you don’t’ have enough time to engage with the OD.
*	More than half of you feel negative about the proposals, and over 60% is now more sceptical about the proposals than when they were launched.
*	Better opportunities for career progression is most widely recognised as a benefit of the proposals. Knowledge not being recognised as a valuable asset is the most widespread concern.

Rep’s Needed 
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to enure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we need volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by contacting Frank Hemmes.
 
	
Branch News
As you might expect, the restructure is consuming most of the BEC’s attention. But we’re keeping our eyes on the other balls out there as well, including: 

*	Risk assessments: We’ve received a second update to the risk assessment for 10SC. This version is much better, with the mitigation actions and their owners clearly specified. We have been promised a similar update for the Commonwealth House Risk Assessment, which we look forward to reviewing. Overall we think the risk assessments are now in a much better place, ensuring safer offices when we do start to go back in.
*	Scotland regional AGM: Laura attended the PCS Scotland Regional AGM on Wednesday. All 8 motions brought forward were carried, including on topics such as consideration of Scottish member definitions of political blackness, menopause at work, and COP26 climate action affiliation.
*	4 Day week Event: On Tuesday Joe Ryle from the 4 Day Week campaign explained their work to us, as well as all the good arguments for a 4 day week. We asked everyone there what they would do with a longer weekend, and maybe surprisingly ‘life admin’ and sorting out the household chores was quite popular, followed by doing more exercise or sport, and taking up hobbies. If you missed the event but are interested in this campaign, you can find more information on the 4 Day Week Campaign here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D7c52cbfd6b%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C374e6c6dc21e402916cc08d952a27b9a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637631680080806236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=bMfanIGMEaokbhp2ISWhySVCJaefZbyCsqjcSvDadBA%3D&reserved=0> , and sign up for their newsletter here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Deb2c82d1db%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C374e6c6dc21e402916cc08d952a27b9a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637631680080806236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=I%2Fk0k7X4d3%2BPeMlGfPdPp%2Ba12UPPHswRkBLuqvRRb4c%3D&reserved=0> .

We have been taking on board your questions on the OD consultation and asking these directly to HR on members behalf. We now have more responses to share with you, which are attached to this email. As these answers are based on the questions you asked during our PCS sessions, they are not for wider circulation. If your colleagues are curious, all they need to do is join ??

 

We are now in the process finalising our mid-consultation response pulling together members concerns and suggestions. This will go out next week for circulation, though it’s not too late to fill in the mid-consultation survey here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLScZ51m6LK91j3jWSsm40ozfYKq6DAE186ojZBzSM4k3YoXjfw%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Caa285e3727c043d1a25408d9539d439a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637632757671067300%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=7RFP4a43BDtsEdJZB2OgYa2THRhQFx8VjLYpZsN4vTM%3D&reserved=0> .

Sorry if my question about the % representation is considered one of those elephant in the room topics but just wondered if we could realistically alter the path the company seem to be taking.

 

The other question that comes to mind - if not already asked - is the unnecessary stress of living with this cycle of project to bench (hate that word, implies unfit) and then wait for next project equivalent to doing ‘soft’ interviews every 6+ months to do the same job!

 

Otherwise, thanks for all the work you guys are doing on our behalf,

"PCS - Rebooting our green and equalities work [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good afternoon everyone, 

 

I know that the OD is at the forefront of everyone’s mind, but as we mentioned in last week’s newsletter, we are still managing to engage on other important issues as well. That is why we have recently written to Ofgem to reboot our environmental and equalities work. There was a lot happening in both these areas before the pandemic, but as the response to Covid took over, this was all put on the backburner. With the offices slowly reopening and things beginning to return to normal, we thought it a good time to refresh both topics. 

 

I have attached the letters we sent to Ofgem, drafted by our amazing Equalities Officer (Cheral Govind) and Green Rep (Samantha Wood). A summary of the items for each letter is also below:

 

Equalities

*	Ofgem has signed up to the Employer Initiative on Domestic Abuse (EIDA). EIDA has a lot of good practice available for employers, and so we are asking Ofgem to implement this as much as possible.
*	The TUC have a charter called ‘Dying to Work’, which commits employers who are signed up to it to put in place protection and support for workers with a terminal illness. We are asking Ofgem to sign up to the Charter and implement its good practice.
*	Before Covid, Ofgem had committed to providing free period products in our offices. Estates was just making arrangements with the building managers when we were all sent home, so we are now checking in to see what the state of play is as we go back to the offices.
*	The recent PCS Conference adopted a motion calling on all branches to negotiate menopause policies for their workplaces. Because while the menopause affects many women, there is still a lot of stigma and silence around it, and hence lots of people don’t get the support or understanding they need. The Trade Union Congress (TUC) has just put out some menopause best practice policies that we are keen to work with Ofgem on.
*	We appreciate the recent update about the Equal Group report that was given on the last all staff call, but we think Ofgem should go further and release the report to all staff, so that everyone knows what is in it.
*	It has been a longstanding aim of both PCS and EnAble to get passports for staff with reasonable adjustments, so that they do not have to renegotiate these every time someone changes team or line manager. With the move to flexible resourcing this will become even more important, and so we are pushing for these to be introduced, and to also cover a broader range of adjustments, such as working patterns or caring responsibilities.

 

Environment

*	We are calling on Ofgem to conduct an environmental audit of its offices and operations, as a starting point for reducing our environmental impact.
*	Now that we are all on Teams, the need for travel is reduced, but some will still take place. We want Ofgem to commit to a ‘trains first’ policy, with flights only used in exceptional circumstances.
*	As a tenant in all our locations, Ofgem doesn’t have direct control over many aspects of the buildings we occupy. But Ofgem does have influence with our landlords or tenant committees. So we think Ofgem should use this to push the building owners and managers to do as much as possible to reduce the environmental impact of our offices.
*	If not already the case, Ofgem should ensure all our energy is 100% renewable. 
*	Although Ofgem doesn’t do a lot of catering, we do think that when we order any, it should be meat free.
*	Before the pandemic there was a Sustainability Working Group composed of staff interested in making Ofgem more environmentally sustainable. It seems the SWG may have gone on pause during Covid, so we’re asking Ofgem to restart it, with our green rep on board, of course.
*	Many of you work at Ofgem because you care about the environment, and that can also mean going to demonstrations, events, rallies or protests. We are asking Ofgem to explicitly affirm that such activities are acceptable under the rules for political engagement set out in the Civil Service Management Code.

"Ofgem answers to PCS questions and upcoming JB discussions [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Morning all,

 

Please see attached our updated questions to Ofgem and responses received, now with added comments. I’ve also reattached our mid-consultation letter sent to ExCo last week. 

Jonathan Brearley is joining the PCS-OFgem weekly consultation meeting tomorrow for half an hour. In the interest of time, we’ve selected for discussion the following issues highlighted in the letter:

 

#1 – Real Living Wage: Ofgem to update the proposed pay levels to reflect its commitment to start paying the Real Living Wage.

#4 – Comprehensive grade mapping: Map staff to new grades based on more than their current wage.

#7 – Expert & Managerial paths: Provide more detail on the Expert and Managerial paths and their interaction. 

#15 - Role assessments: Ofgem must evidence the need for managers to reapply for managerial roles through the use of comparative role assessments. Where a difference of greater than 25% cannot be demonstrated, roles must be slotted in where reasonably practicable.

#21 - Corporate services capability: We ask Ofgem to provide assurances that it has the operational processes, systems and capacity to run flexible resourcing adequately. Ideally this is demonstrated via an independent audit. 

#24 - Equality Impact Assessment: Conduct and publish an Equality Impact Assessment of the proposals, including mitigations where the proposals either exacerbate historic discriminatory impacts, or generate new ones. 

#26 - Mid-consultation stocktake: Ofgem to do a mid-consultation stocktake, which should include amendments to the proposals based on staff feedback. 

 

We’ll aim to get something in the diary before the end of the week to report back on these discussions and agree our next steps.

 

Best,

Laura

"PCS - Mid-consultation response to Ofgem [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

Now that we are entering the second half of the consultation period, we believe that the time for clarifying and explaining is over, and we now need to see some meaningful changes to the OD proposals. Ofgem cannot hold off on this until after the consultation period is over, because unless we see the OD proposals change in real time in response to staff feedback, meaningful consultation and dialogue is impossible. To kickstart this process, we sent our provisional PCS consultation response to HR and ExCo yesterday. This response covers 28 concrete recommendations on how to change the proposals, based on your input and feedback. We have asked Ofgem to respond to each of these points by 11 August, so that there is time left for further dialogue afterwards. 

 

Because you were instrumental in putting this together, you of course also deserve to see the end product. So we have attached our letter to Ofgem. It’s comprehensive and hence a bit long, so if you just want to know what the 28 recommendations are, you can jump to the annex. Of course, we would like all staff about this as well. So while we remain banned from the Wire (boo!), we do encourage you to forward this to colleagues. 

 

While you’re here

*	Our consultation stocktake survey is still live. We’ll share the current results with Ofgem shortly, but will continue running the survey to know what you think about the OD. If you haven’t yet filled out it, please do so here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLScZ51m6LK91j3jWSsm40ozfYKq6DAE186ojZBzSM4k3YoXjfw%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C0bde00a27af44bad11d208d957325591%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637636696255167274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=cJwG2hXZKJ0nw4rhoocj67VKNyBAmoINXO%2Bs%2FNxMC5M%3D&reserved=0> . You can also share this with non-member colleagues.
*	Missing out on the newsletter? Don’t worry, we are still sending it, but it is probably being filtered as spam by Outlook. We’ve asked Ofgem to fix this, but in the meantime, you can fix this yourself by finding the newsletter in your junkmail and telling Outlook PCS most certainly isn’t junk!
*	We are also collecting for a branch donation to the strike fund of PCS members at the Royal Parks. These are outsourced cleaners who are fighting for equal pay and conditions with the Royal Parks’ inhouse staff. Your contribution will support them while they are unpaid during their strike. You can make the donation here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpaypal.me%2Fpools%2Fc%2F8BADin7JMS&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C0bde00a27af44bad11d208d957325591%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637636696255177224%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=RFblN8E00neRABdd%2FrrA2L2TPnYhHm30dOHvze8SwhQ%3D&reserved=0> .

PCS responds to inaccurate media reports about civil servants and returning to the office

Throughout the unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, PCS has always prioritised the safety of its members. At the height of the pandemic which led to more than 150,000 deaths in the UK alone, we came up with 5 safety tests <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D1de9a51470%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cdaa5b06c727f4ecde6b008d95d911e5b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637643700597204346%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=GZ68nIPkeFZ8rN8AGH4Y%2FnbrxikrD7q6TzEh7Me3O60%3D&reserved=0>  and negotiated homeworking for the majority of our members. Where civil servants could not work from home and attended the workplace, both sets of workers have indeed served the public and kept society functioning. PCS firmly disagrees with some journalists comments about hardworking and diligent civil servants as somehow “shirking” or “twiddling their thumbs” because they are currently working from home.

PCS warns of action if ministers try to cut pay of civil servants over office opening

Anonymous briefings over the weekend to the press have suggested civil servants' pay could be docked if staff refuse to return to the office. Responding to the reports, a PCS spokesman said: ""It is the height of cowardice for ministers to anonymously brief the media about docking civil servants' pay for not returning to the office.

Help support Royal Parks workers taking strike action

PCS members working for Just Ask Services at the Royal Parks are going on strike from 16 to 30 August. They are demanding no job losses (current plans are that a third of them be made redundant) and that their sick pay and other terms and conditions be the same as those employed directly by the Royal Parks. In taking strike action, these low paid workers are making a real financial sacrifice. PCS is providing strike pay but each extra pound raised <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D9e706c9dbf%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cdaa5b06c727f4ecde6b008d95d911e5b%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637643700597214303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2BCDr6P2rzFMau%2Bbfun27LWYpMYZ9ZMyuw1IdXl2q7y4%3D&reserved=0>  helps lessen the losses our members face.

This week we held OD workshops aimed at Bands A:C, and D separately, as well as a D&I specific one and it was great to see many of you in attendance and sharing honest thoughts and concerns - if you ever have additional comments feel free to email the inbox or contact the BEC.

Now we are at the mid-way point of the consultation we have sent 28 recommendations of improvement for the OD proposals and a copy of the letter has been sent to all members and the network chairs too – check you inbox and feel free to distribute within your teams.

Restructure hot or not 

*	 Hot: Getting on with your work because your team now has all the staff and skills it needs through flexible resourcing. 
*	Not: Not actually getting on with your work because Ofgem is chronically understaffed and we just end up moving vacancies around.

It is more important than ever to ensure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we need volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by contacting Frank Hemmes.
	
BEC Update 
As you would expect, most of our time is going into the OD right now. But that doesn’t mean we’re sitting still on other matters of importance. Here is what else is going on this week:

*	Environment: We are rebooting our campaign to make Ofgem itself more sustainable. We have written to Ofgem, reminding them of our ideas on how to reduce Ofgem’s environmental footprint so we can lead by example, and asking to reboot the Sustainability Working Group. If you’re interested in being a part of this, get in touch with Samanta Wood.
*	Equality: We have also written to Ofgem asking for an update on the equality initiatives we were progressing before the pandemic. This includes initiatives on domestic abuse, support for terminally ill employees and free provision of period products. But we have also updated this to include newer demands, such as for Ofgem to share the Equal Group review of our D&I strategy, and introduce ‘reasonable adjustment passports’. If you want to know more, speak to Cheral Govind.
*	Flexible working: With the OD going on, you’d think Ofgem had enough on their hands. And yet, they are also looking to revisit the flexible/smart working policy. We don’t mind this, but we want to do this right and consult you on what you think. So rather than slapping a few comments on a draft in a matter of days, we have asked for this work to be delayed until the OD has progressed and we have more time.

Most workers want to see a four-day working week pilot implemented across all business areas of Scottish Government, according to a scoping project of more than 2000 employees.

"OD Consultation - Further PCS engagement with Ofgem [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good afternoon everyone,

 

We’re staying strong on the engagement with Ofgem, and have fired two more formal letters their way this week. As always we think you should have sight of what we do, so they’re attached for you to have a read through, and you are free to share them with colleagues as well. In this case, we allied ourselves with the FDA and jointly submitted the letters. What they cover is respectively:

 

1.	Our contention that Ofgem has not adequately demonstrated the need for staff in managerial roles to reapply for their jobs, and that we expect Ofgem to deal with this to comply with trade union legislation and civil service protocols.
2.	The request to conclude and publish the Equality Impact Assessment on the proposals as soon as possible, given the risk of existing inequalities being baked into the new structure from the start.

 

We are however concerned that we are now running out of time for Ofgem to address both issues while still allowing meaningful consultation, so we also call for the OD consultation to be either delayed or extended, maybe partially, to give us all more time to work through these critical elements.

 

As always, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. 

 

Cheerio,

Frank

 

PS. Unfortunately we have not yet received a detailed response to our 28 recommendations, so sadly no update there. We will let you know as soon as we have it.

Restructure News 	

We are now about to enter the last week of the consultation. You will hopefully have seen the further letters we sent Ofgem, jointly with the FDA, to express concern about the absence of en Equalities Impact Assessment so far, and the need to mitigate against potential redundancies. You can share those letters with your colleagues. We have been promised a response, plus also a response to our 28 recommendations, by the end of this week.
It is fair to say that we are disappointed with where we are at this moment. Crucial details of the proposals have not been provided, and we had expected to see more examples of how the proposals changed in response to your feedback. We will consider all this as we draft our final consultation response next week.

BEC Update 

*	Environment: While the OD consultation is consuming most of our waking hours, our Green Rep, Sammie, is not letting all things eco slide, and has started a Yammer group for any eco-minded colleagues to discuss any and all things climate and sustainability related – Although we’re very much in our infancy we’re open to all so feel free to see what we’re up to and join us here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D116464c940%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cddd68105933146c730d708d963a68a71%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637650389217724831%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=T7ulb2dIdAdJzX35EWia6twniZZJNqtNpKDprPAfvOs%3D&reserved=0> .
	Wire: Following further engagement with Ofgem and Comms, we believe we now have an arrangement where we can again publish on the Wire via Comms, just like everyone else at Ofgem. We hope to get a number of articles up next week about the work we’ve been doing during the consultation, so watch this space!
	Pay: We have received the pay offer for this year from Ofgem. As we expected, it adheres closely to the Treasury Pay Remit, which imposes a pay freeze across the civil service. In the absence of much room to negotiate, and with the OD going on at the same time, the BEC has decided we will not ballot members this year and instead formulate our response informed by the overall position of the union.

	
Rep’s still needed!
 
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to ensure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we are always in need of volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by contacting Frank Hemmes.

Call for Ministers to accept refugees from Afghanistan
As the situation in Afghanistan has becoming increasingly concerning for the safety and well being of the Afghan people. It has been requested by MP’s and charities that the UK government resettles at least 20,000 Afghan over the next 2 years (in addition to those already being evacuated under the Aghan Relocations and Assistance Policy). The government announced yesterday the acceptance of only 5,000 refugees over the next year, with 15,000 over future years. The charity Safe Passage (who spoke with Ofgem for World Refugee Day) has called for people to send an email to their MP to show the gravity of the situation.

Help support Royal Parks workers taking strike action
PCS members working for Just Ask Services at the Royal Parks are going on strike from 16 to 30 August. They are demanding no job losses (current plans are that a third of them be made redundant) and that their sick pay and other terms and conditions be the same as those employed directly by the Royal Parks. In taking strike action, these low paid workers are making a real financial sacrifice. PCS is providing strike pay but each extra pound raised <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Da494f9f4e9%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cddd68105933146c730d708d963a68a71%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637650389217734785%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=M92Aefw9u8z4pJLshbPhR7WVCM95yGGbqYVH5s6TA1M%3D&reserved=0>  helps lessen the losses our members face.

"PCS Analysis of the proposed pay increments [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good morning everyone,


With only a few days left in the OD consultation, we want to share with you our analysis of different scenarios for the proposed in-grade pay increments. We had hoped that Ofgem would have given us a sneak preview of the likely value of the increments by now, but lacking that, we’ve just gone ahead and had our own look at it. 

 

In our provisional response to the consultation we recommended that Ofgem set the in-grade increments at one third of the pay span for a grade (the difference between the minimum and maximum wage). Now that we have conducted our analysis, we are even more convinced that this is the most sensible option. Our analysis suggests that if the increments are set much lower, for example at 10% of the pay span, the overall reduction in grades will actually lead to worse outcomes for staff, especially over the longer term. 

 

I’m mindful that we have a lot of very experienced economists and other analysists in our membership. So if after reading this you think we’ve missed a trick or got it totally wrong, please do be in touch before we submit our final response on Friday ??

 

We encourage everyone to share this document with teams and colleagues.

PS. We’re conscious that some of you have reached out to us over the last few weeks and we haven’t been able to respond to everyone, as the OD work is definitely consuming the bulk of our time. We do endeavour to get back to everyone eventually though, so please bear with us.

"PCS member engagement summary [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi all,

Hope you’re doing well. 

Attached is a summary of all written responses and session notes we’ve gathered from you over the course of the past two months. It’s from this input that we’ve pulled together our mid-consultation and final responses from the union, with the latter due in your inboxes tomorrow. Thank you once again for putting forward your thoughts so eloquently! It’s really helped us make our messages heard.

 

You may have also noticed that a number of directors have been sharing and supporting our mid-consultation response. Please do share the final letter with your colleagues/managers if you’re comfortable doing so.

A further side note: although formal consultation may have come to an end, we’ve agreed with Ofgem to continue weekly OD engagement to stay on top of progress. We’ll continue to report back in the weekly newsletter.

Best,

Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) have undertaken extensive membership engagement and drafted our mid-consultation response covering the topics that are important to you. We shared this response with Ofgem on 3 August to inform the second part of the consultation and trust it will carefully consider this, as it has committed to do with all staff feedback received until the end of the consultation period.
We have provided constructive feedback where we believe the proposals can be enhanced and sought further clarification where we think more detail would benefit members' understanding of the proposals. We will continue to engage with members and will provide a full consultation response as the consultation draws to a close.
We have provided 28 suggestions and questions to Ofgem, which are outlined here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dc891f45d47%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C0e1da8a2ead3494e8c1a08d9695b438a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637656662972533367%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=9LcUoVrlJZKOHkZSQFt6fy%2F3hAia6TnGglCsosxyvTY%3D&reserved=0> .

Call for Ministers to accept refugees from Afghanistan
As the situation in Afghanistan has becoming increasingly concerning for the safety and well being of the Afghan people. It has been requested by MP’s and charities that the UK government resettles at least 20,000 Afghan over the next 2 years (in addition to those already being evacuated under the Aghan Relocations and Assistance Policy). The government announced yesterday the acceptance of only 5,000 refugees over the next year, with 15,000 over future years. The charity Safe Passage (who spoke with Ofgem for World Refugee Day) has called for people to send an email to their MP to show the gravity of the situation.

Royal Parks: First week of strike action ends on a high
After a week of industrial action, workers at Just Ask remain determined to win. Planning more campaign activities next week, ending in a large public protest on bank holiday monday. The strike is over 6 issues, the key ones being possible staffing cuts later this year and winning the same sick pay as staff who are directly employed by the Royal Parks.

PCS A to Z: Anti-racist and anti-fascist campaigning
Each week we are going through the alphabet with the PCS A to Z to look at why government workers should join and get involved in PCS – A is for our anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign work. PCS has a proud history of campaigning against racism and fascism <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D1c7c59a1da%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C0e1da8a2ead3494e8c1a08d9695b438a%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637656662972563231%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=B%2F4rTgjNfSzcBgaYupW0pPjDbXd9%2FkqmY4qU7qNjgjQ%3D&reserved=0>  and it is our agreed policy to oppose racist and fascist organisations in our workplaces and communities.
Where individuals are found to be union members and exhibit values that are racist or fascistic, members should report individuals to their branch officers and seek advice from their PCS headquarters official or the equality department. As part of our anti-racism and anti-fascism strategy where reps believe racist/fascist behaviour and actions are occurring in the workplace, such issues should be raised with management at the appropriate level.
Each workplace represented by PCS, whether in the core civil service or in the commercial sector should have an appropriate departmental or employer code. This should include equality provision with discrimination and harassment policies derived from the civil service code of conduct.

"PCS final OD consultation response and Ofgem pay 'offer' [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Good morning everyone,

 

As the OD consultation drew to a close last Friday, the PCS branch executive submitted our final response. It did not change massively compared to our mid-consultation response, and we stand by our original 28 recommendations. In this final response, we have however focused more on items that are particularly urgent, important, or where disagreement with Ofgem remains. We have been promised continued engagement while Ofgem is digesting the responses to the consultation, and we will keep you informed about what comes out of this.

 

At the same time, we have also engaged with Ofgem on this year’s pay ‘offer’. Which isn’t really an offer as such as Ofgem is bound by the civil service wide pay freeze instituted by Treasury. This means no pay adjustment for everyone earning over £24,000, and a small increase of up to £250 for workers earning less than that. Of course, with inflation not at 0%, this means an effective pay cut for most of us, on top of the below-inflation pay adjustments we have had over the last decade. Ofgem will still pay performance payments, in the same way as last year. This means performance pay for both ‘achievers’ and ‘high performers’, with Bands A-C getting a bit more relatively.

*	We are making good progress on getting local PCS ambassadors in each portfolio in Ofgem, but there are a lot of teams that don’t have one yet. If you’re interested in a low key way of helping us build the union, this is probably the role for you. Interested? Then get in touch with Frank Hemmes.

?As the consultation closed last week, we submitted our final response, based on the extensive engagement we’ve had a union branch. The focus of the final response was on urgent changes that are needed, and where we disagree with the proposals. We’ve also undertaken analysis of the new pay levels and sub-levels, and concluded that the sub-level steps (2a/b/c etc.) need to be set at at least 25% of the pay level to see any benefit from the current pay progression structure.

Engagement will continue while Ofgem looks through the masses of feedback they’ve received from you. This means there is an opportunity for us to feed in how staff are feeling about the proposals now that the consultation has ended. To this end, we’re running another survey, similar to the mid-consultation one, to see how you feel about the proposals, what your expectations are going forward, and which changes you really want or don't want to see.

Consultancy Fees 	

McKinsey & Co – transformation programme consultancy

Ofgem has spent a grand total of £750,000 on McKinsey’s consultancy services supporting the transformation programme since March 2021. This is vast sum of money on consultancy which has produced, as is widely agreed, an OD proposal severely lacking detail. We’re going back to HR to try and understand the work completed and how the rationale for the OD was put together. Watch this space.

For those interested, the breakdown of all consultancy fees over £25,000 in a month paid by Ofgem is publicly available here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0482f23a3c%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C5e16f0dca9a5473b6cbb08d96eb10327%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637662528824701560%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=tpCrl2oRe%2FVOUpjZfwIPABmaQWi36t2BKJP%2Bbx3bWyE%3D&reserved=0> .

Pay Remit 	
The pay remit has been confirmed for 2020-21 pay. This information is for PCS members only, and shouldn’t be circulated.
Unfortunately, Ofgem are bound by the Treasury pay freeze, meaning there are no adjustments for colleagues base pay for anyone earning over £24,000. With inflation not at 0%, that’s effectively a pay cut. Central PCS are do not agree with Treasury over the pay freeze, and effectively PCS Ofgem branch have stated that we expressly do not agree with the proposal, though appreciate that it will be taken forwards.
For those earning less than £24,000, there is an underpin salary increase of £250.
For performance related pay, the same proposal as last year was presented, which is differentiates by pay band, meaning bands A-C see a slightly higher percentage bonus than bands D and E: 

*	Bands A-C: 5% of actual salaries for ‘High Performing’, and 2.5% of actual salaries for ‘Achieving’

*	Bands D-E: 4% of actual salaries for ‘High Performing’, and 2% of actual salaries for ‘Achieving’

BEC Update 
BEC Update
First off we are still very busy managing the OD Transformational programme which is really tanking the time we have available for wider Union matters. If there are people out there with capacity to get involved then please let us know because support would be really welcome.


Other than that we are pleased to say that we are back on the Wire, although we are still engaged in negotiations on how visible this will be, with Comms not entirely keen on putting our articles on the home page.
 
	
Rep’s still needed!
 
Throughout the Organisational Transition Consultation and beyond, both members and non-members will have questions and queries important to them. It is more important than ever to ensure that everyone in the organisation feels heard and we are always in need of volunteers to act as local reps to continue to spread our message and encourage more people to join the union! If interested in becoming a local rep for your Team please contact us by emailing PCS@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:PCS@ofgem.gov.uk>  or by contacting Frank Hemmes.

PCS Welcomes the first female General Secretary of Unite
PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka has written to Sharon Graham to congratulate her on her general secretary election victory and becoming the first woman to lead Unite.
Mark’s letter to Sharon says:
“Workers up and down the country need unions like never before and I have no doubt that under your leadership, Unite will be ready to face the challenges ahead.
“We share the view that the workers who have kept this country going during the pandemic shouldn’t be the ones who pay the price. It’s clear members of our unions have issues in common and as we navigate the turbulent months and years ahead, I look forward to working with you to strengthen the union movement and empower workers.”
Sharon replaces Len McCluskey, who has been Unite general secretary since 2011.  She was the clear winner in the leadership ballot, with 37.7% of the vote.
	
DVLA Action: Last Day of Targeted Strike Action
The Strike by Drivers Medical staff ran for the whole of August with strong support.  Staff we chosen strategically to impact backlog reduction and other key roles.
PCS has written to the DVLA’s Chief Executive about the impact of their decision to to avoid the subject for three months, and the impact that has had to the DVLA’s ability to serve the public.
Interestingly, the strike action may have helped reduce the recent massive upsurge in covid cases on site.

PCS A to Z: Bullying – How PCS can help.
Each week we are going through the alphabet with the PCS A to Z to look at why government workers should join and get involved in PCS – this week B is for Bullying.
PCS demands that their members have the right to be treated with dignity and respect in a working environment free from bullying, harassment or discrimination.
Unfortunately, bullying takes many forms, all of which are unacceptable, especially in the workplace.  Bullying can vary from obvious abuse to small comments that leave you feeling uncomfortable without quite knowing why, something most of us will experience at some point in our working lives.
Fortunately PCS is always here to help, even if you just want to check in and discuss something that is making you uncomfortable.  Bullying can be a sensitive subject to discuss when it is a part of a workplace relationship so we’re here to listen without judgement and be reassured that PCS will never take further action without your consent.
PCS is currently offerening training on recognising bullying in the workplace, find out about this and other courses available to PCS members here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D8ca336b7b3%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C5e16f0dca9a5473b6cbb08d96eb10327%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637662528824731547%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=E29cuFUPe06MyyeoOrbjeJWeTXEiH0vwZ9MnY2Mo348%3D&reserved=0>

"PCS - Post-consultation stocktake [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi all,

 

I wanted to flag to everyone that the PCS union is running a survey, open to all staff, on your feelings towards the OD.

The Ofgem consultation on the OD has now closed. We've submitted our final response, but engagement will continue while Ofgem assesses all the feedback they've received. As part of this engagement, we want to update our the findings of our mid-consultation stocktake, to see how people feel about the proposals now that the consultation has closed, what your expectations are going forward, and which changes you really want or don't want to see. 

Please note that all questions are optional.

Branch News 	
Well, the BEC is taking a bit of a break after all that exciting OD activity. You can’t write lengthy consultation responses every day, after all. Still, there is enough to report on: 

*	OD: Yes, we are still engaging with Ofgem as they wrestle themselves through the masses of feedback they’ve received. This includes matters such as the challenge process and the new ‘Hybrid Working’ policy.
*	Wire: Yes, we’re back on the Wire with updates on our environmental and equalities work. More info further down this newsletter, so read on McDuff!
*	Learning: We’re getting a lot of info now from PCS about various union-run courses and workshops. We will circulate this to the best of our ability, but it remains tricky without a Union Learning Rep. So, if you have always wanted to develop that inner coach of yours, now is the time to tell us ??
*	Black History Month: Difficult as it is to accept, we’re getting closer to October. So, we have started our thinking on activities for Black History Month, to meet the high bar we’ve set over previous years. If you’d like to be involved, do get in touch with Cheral.

*	COP26: Likewise, we’re thinking about what activities we can do to coincide with COP26. Our Green Rep Sammie is already full of ideas, but if you have some of our own, let us know!

Post-OD Stocktake
We are still running our survey to understand how you feel now that the formal OD consultation is over, and the outputs of that will feed into our weekly engagement with Ofgem. We’re looking to get a critical mass of responses so that we can share something robust with HR before they complete their analysis of the consultation feedback, so that we can continue to influence the process. We’re well over 50 responses now, but ideally we want to get at least 200. So help us out by completing it, and sharing it with your colleagues.

Campaigns and news 	

PCS opposes Universal Credit cut

PCS opposes the removal of the £20 a week uplift of Universal Credit, particularly at a time when unemployment is likely to increase as a result of the end of the furlough scheme.

In real terms, the government intends to cut Universal Credit payments by between 15% and 25% to all claimants at the end of this month.

PCS welcomed the introduction of the uplift in April 2020 as a measure to support people whose income was impacted by the pandemic.

Many thousands of PCS members working in DWP, the government department responsible for the delivery of UC, are paid so poorly that they are forced to claim it. They are subject to a public sector pay freeze so the cut in UC, the increase in National Insurance payments on top of the pay freeze will mean that they will take three separate hits from the government in a short space of time.

PCS Restarts discussions on Environmental and Carbon impact items

As most of us are aware, our world is deteriorating due to mankind's abuse of fossil fuels and the destruction of our planet's natural resources. Being the energy regulator with a key role in net zero, Ofgem should look to reduce its own carbon footprint as much as possible.

Unions write to health secretary over job losses

At least 20% of staff at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which licenses Covid-19 vaccines in the UK, are threatened with job cuts.

PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka has written a joint letter with the general secretaries of Prospect, FDA, UCU and the assistant general secretary of Unite, to Sajid Javid, secretary of state for health and social care.

This is in response to the announcement of staff cuts of at least 20% at MHRA. Lots of MHRA staff are actually our ‘neighbours’ in 10SC, and so we will look at what we can do practically to show solidarity with them in any action they take.

Post-OD Stocktake

We are still running our survey to understand how you feel now that the formal OD consultation is over, and the outputs of that will feed into our weekly engagement with Ofgem. We’re looking to get a critical mass of responses so that we can share something robust with HR before they complete their analysis of the consultation feedback, so that we can continue to influence the process. We’re well over 50 responses now, but ideally we want to get at least 200. So help us out by completing it, and sharing it with your colleagues.

Unions must work together to fight cuts

PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka told an online People’s Assembly pre-TUC Congress rally at lunchtime that unions must come together to fight racism, inequality, the climate emergency, and cuts to pay and pensions.

Sarah Woolley, general secretary of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union, said there has “never been a more critical time to come together and fight back. Claps don’t pay the bills and a minimum wage of £15, decent sick pay and ending of zero-hours contracts would go some way to rewarding key workers,” she said.

She urged workers to: “Organise your workplace and your community to grow our movement and improve the lives of our movement and our class.” To read the article in full please see here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dab5e0f3f8d%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cacca4223837841b48be608d9790f2816%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637673928277450783%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=zB%2FsYaiZJ%2FNAQNXNHvaaTbkkK9l%2BJs6%2BLXxnBFU9j%2F4%3D&reserved=0> .

Congress called on the General Council to support unions to ensure the health, safety and welfare of Black workers are taken seriously and supported as a collective issue and not individualised.

It also called for a campaign to change the national curriculum to include Black history, the slave trade and the colonial empire and its impact and to campaign for the under-representation of black people in political life. And employers should be required to conduct regular mandatory equality impact assessments.

 BEC Update
 
This week your reps met with HR to discuss the new Hybrid Working and Anti-Bullying and Harassment policies…notably after they had already signed off some key details with ExCo, including changes to core working hours. Some of our concerns included the continued reliance on your line manager for the agreement of informal working arrangements, despite the OD consultation’s adamance that there will be far fewer line managers with lots more reportees to look after. Please note that our edits have not yet been accepted, and we have to reserve our comments until the final version is in place.

We also met with our full-time officer at PCS to discuss our plan of action for the outcomes of the OD, and support mechanisms for any casework arising from it.

It also supports the PCS position that your union would not support any progression steps set lower than a quarter of the pay range for a grade which would result in worse pay outcomes for staff, especially over the long term.

Gen Z battles to bring back unions, one Starbucks at a time

Young workers across the United States are reviving trade unionism – go Gen Z! <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2c268fa9e8%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C040546db028341788a3e08d97e93b21c%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637679995086447140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8soo%2BPkwVkhq%2B9uVVOO7LqDzragj8HzwbjPUm6wezdw%3D&reserved=0>  The United States has a long and under-represented history of trade unionism and social justice dating back to the Industrial Revolution. The strong links between the labour movement and civil rights movement led to the end of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. In recent decades, union membership and organised labour has declined but rates are now bouncing back as young workers, with the backing of the majority of the public, organise to improve working conditions and pay. We love to see it.

The fight for union rights at GCHQ
 
On 25th January 1984, the Conservative Foreign Secretary announced that trade unions would be banned from the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ). This decision marked the start of one of the most intensive campaigns for the union movement, especially after 14 workers at GCHQ were sacked after refusing to take a government bribe and give up a basic right at work.

Hear from those involved in the long campaign to restore union rights and reinstate the sacked workers at GCHQ.

"PCS updates following today's OD announcement [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear member,

 

We think you’ll agree that the OD process is an interesting one. Certainly it’s keeping us busy. It’s fair to say we’re disappointed in much of the announcement and the consultation response document HR have written, and have made this clear. 

 

But to let you know about our immediate actions and updates:

 

Members meeting on Friday 1 October

It’s your union. We want you to inform us on what you want our next step to be. We’ve set up a meeting tomorrow to listen to your thoughts and concerns following today’s announcement, and to define our next steps.

 

Meeting invite for 12pm should be with you shortly.

 

New survey live

We’ve set up a new survey to collate your feedback following today’s announcement. This will help us present evidence back to HR/OD. Please share your views, and circulate it to your colleages, PCS member or not.

 

Link to Survey here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSdAg6_g11jTYFdkHeHMk-n7XjNGkhyKmS9eAy7sQwLsPokKgA%2Fviewform%3Fusp%3Dsf_link&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C7789e75372e4493c655c08d98431c3e0%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637686171702898157%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=yZLWvo6ETk63VHxZ%2BsJEENXrJr%2F5KebhilRkveRWk%2BI%3D&reserved=0>  

 

Today’s response letter from PCS to ExCo

We’ve sent our immediate response to the consultation announcement to ExCo this afternoon (attached). We’ve highlighted our key concerns. Again, please feel free to circulate this letter to any colleagues.

 

While you’re here:

We are making good progress on getting local PCS ambassadors in each portfolio in Ofgem, but there are a lot of teams that don’t have one yet. If you’re interested in a low key way of helping us build the union, this is probably the role for you. Interested? Then get in touch with Frank Hemmes.

Black History Month 2021

The month of October is Black History Month in October, a celebration and remembrance of the African and Caribbean (and for some, also any non-white) diaspora. The month aims to honour the often-unheralded accomplishments of Black Britons throughout history and for any colleagues who joined us after October 2020 Cheral’s wire article <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3De29b6a4924%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C8bd3940ad50d4edaceca08d987d962e1%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637690190011411740%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=LzfG%2BiWo3zWlVX3mx%2B38NDIz0Lak%2Fwj7S6EAdOwGOQ8%3D&reserved=0>  on this last year is a great read!

PCS boycotts civil service people survey in MOJ

Following a debate and agreement of motion A8 at the 2021 PCS MOJ Group Conference PCS are recommending that Ministry Of Justice members boycott the civil service people survey.

It is the PCS view that the employer desires a high participation rate to demonstrate that staff engagement is high rather than addressing the issues and concerns highlighted by the survey responses.

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal today handed down its ruling in Kate Wilson’s epic ten-year legal battle over the use of undercover police against protest movements.

"RE: Document showing my interim role as an E banded post [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Absolutely. Can you save a copy of that locally? If you can give me sight of the role profile you were given I can try and run it past a job evaluation accredited assessor &#8211; we have a few in the union. 
 
Ideally we&#8217;d have the role profile for the E role for application, but since that may be delayed for some time it&#8217;s probably best to work with what we&#8217;ve got to hand now.

Subject: Document showing my interim role as an E banded post [OFFICIAL Internal Only]
 
Hi Laura,
 
I mentioned the department headcount/budget plan that has been in existence since last April or earlier as proof that the (interim) head of data insight role is indeed at Band E.
 
Below is a snapshot showing &#8216;my role&#8217; at row 29. In every version of this file right up to the current one dated 20th September (see second snapshot below), you can see it defines this role and other &#8216;head of&#8217; roles including Chris&#8217;s as Band E (column G) for an existing employee (column I) in role from April last (column O). Is this enough to argue the point?
 
Rory

"Retail drop-ins (1/2)","Hi all,

Putting some short drop-ins in the diary to hear from retail members (and everyone whose work is being affected by the energy crisis) about:

*	how you’re getting on
*	if remuneration for overtime has been made clear to you
*	anything else you think the union should be aware of
*	any messages or demands you’d like the union to take to Ofgem relating to this work

 

If you can’t make it to any of these slots but have something to share, please drop us an email at pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk>  and one of the reps will get back to you asap.

 

Depending on numbers, we can add more drop-ins at a later date.

Working in Retail?

In the BEC we have seen (and some have experienced!) the high levels of fatigue and stress experienced by our fantastic colleagues in Retail who truly put consumers ahead of themselves. We want all colleagues who are overworked to reach out any time with any comments. Thanks to those who attended our Retail drop ins and for sharing your experiences and concerns. Please share the below tips widely if it would be helpful in your teams: 

1.	Log the hours you have been working – this tracker <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D48d62bca3a%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd7cb59db92534783d30508d9947d6770%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637704088608240007%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=wFgQSfnFCR8e2uac8QJ0gsy0VkfWd0JIpYHF%2BfwjWqs%3D&reserved=0>  is particularly helpful to keep a tally of time spent working over the hours you are meant to, and can help to reconcile flexi/overtime.
	 
2.	The Pay and Reward <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D3d849017d2%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd7cb59db92534783d30508d9947d6770%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637704088608240007%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=AChmvYIgqbnjwUAvPf9YTPYoGCvckn4Dq1HMPdG4GXg%3D&reserved=0>  policy outlines how to claim overtime, and we wholeheartedly will challenge that the overtime must have required prior authorisation. We encourage colleagues to at least log any overtime on MyHR as Ofgem may not pay for overtime/and it cannot be logged on MyHR if it has been more than three months after the fact.

	
Organisational Design

Out of everything going on members may enjoy that Ofgem's very own Organisational Design has been mentioned in the news on this page <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dde31167c6e%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd7cb59db92534783d30508d9947d6770%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637704088608250007%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=MEOxPXbVrXgHc08Vz2w3GCS%2FeMOWrdfuXuiT6RRndT0%3D&reserved=0>  (Under Ofgem self-harm). I feel it captures the mood well and I honestly feel like I could have wrote this myself.
	
Looking for ‘Local’ organisers

For the last few years Frank has helped out in the PCS ‘Local’ for 10SC, known as the ‘Canary Club’. He is now stepping back, and somewhat quicker than expected because of the situation in Retail. Ofgem has always been one of the more active branches in the Canary Club, and we’d like to keep it that way. So we’re looking for someone who’s enthused about working with other branches to set up activities and support each other across 10SC. If you’re interested or would like to know more, just contact Frank.

PCS responds to media attacks on civil servants

The last few weeks have seen numerous attempts in the right-wing press to blame some of the country’s woes, such as the chaos in Afghanistan or the HGV driver shortage, on civil servants. In Tribune, our general secretary Mark Serwotka strongly refutes this propaganda, pointing out that civil servants have worked throughout Covid to keep the country running.

Brutal cut to Universal Credit - PCS demands reversal

On the 6th October we saw the government’s decision to withdraw the £20 uplift to Universal Credit (UC) implemented; a decision that will plunge millions into serious financial hardship and many into poverty. For some of us these cuts are compounded by the current pay freeze, the forecast rise in inflation, and proposed hike in National Insurance contributions from April. All of which will see our members' income significantly reduced.

 BEC Update
 

*	This week the BEC submitted a Freedom of Information request to Ofgem (available for you to read here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dee7ff5d3bc%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C45f4b08c715345ff393608d99ac58edd%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637710995570737231%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=tfMo7goq7ELKekNUDz3IoHeDNPOUyopU7AizuD2ZUjE%3D&reserved=0> ) seeking publication of the Equal Group's report on the state of Diversity and Inclusion in the organisation, which Ofgem has refused to provide to us in joint negotiations. A near identical FOI submitted by union members over at the Competitions and Markets Authority not long ago was successful in making public its own equalities report (it was not good news).

Update on Equalities Actions:

Following the Equalities Action items we raised with Ofgem <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D2e09cfa889%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C45f4b08c715345ff393608d99ac58edd%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637710995570747226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=jdBH15oEg8xUbbt%2BAuOYQDy%2FCSCNgSrvAYp%2BiKxQJRY%3D&reserved=0> . We have received responses summarised below: 

1.	Implementation of the EIDA best practice: Whilst stating the Domestic Abuse guidance which sign posts to other resources for help and support. Employees may also request special leave for unforeseen circumstances, and we will recommend clarifying that special leave may indeed be used for domestic abuse situations.
	 
2.	Signing up to Dying to Work: Ofgem found they already provide some of the recommendations by the TUC Dying to Work charter – and since existing Civil Service guidance was not advocating centrally signing up to the charter Ofgem will not be taking it further. We will encourage Ofgem to reconsider this.
	 
3.	Provision of period products: This action is complete for now as free period products are available in London and Glasgow offices and supplies to Ofgem staff will be sent to Cardiff staff colleagues. We are thrilled about this as we have called for this pre-pandemic.
	 
4.	Menopause Policy: Ofgem have confirmed they would be happy to engage with PCS guidance when creating a Menopause policy Ofgem are planning to create as part of the Ofgem Health and Wellbeing Strategy. Again we are delighted to move forwards with Ofgem on this to support colleagues.
	 
5.	Disability/Reasonable Adjustment Passport: As our colleagues may be aware, Ofgem will be implementing a Reasonable Adjustment passport as part of the OD. Again we are happy to see this taken forwards as we have similarly called for a disability passport as for some time.

PCS’s response to Rishi’s spending review.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his spending review and budget on Wednesday, promising to level up, grow the economy and lift the public sector pay freeze.
However, Mr Sunak who has been suggesting the freeze would end, produced few details, saying it would be ""fair and affordable"" and that there would be a ""return to the normal independent pay setting process."" 
Responding to the Spending Review, PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""For all the talk of lifting the public sector pay freeze, when it comes to the crunch, the Chancellor has shown his promises are merely fake news. With inflation running at 3.1%, with some forecasts predicting 5% by early 2022, any lifting of pay below that level, is akin to real terms cut. None of today's rhetoric will do anything to alleviate the real economic hardship our members are experiencing every day.”

PCS Celebrates Young Workers Month.

Young Workers' Month in November is a key opportunity for PCS to highlight and campaign on the most important issues for young workers. PCS young members have successfully held their first virtual seminar and will now focus on Young Workers' Month.

PCS agreed to freeze subscription costs for 2022.

Each year it isn’t uncommon for subscription fees to increase to cover higher costs rising from inflation and to keep the same level of services for members.

COP26 Global Day of Action.

World leaders meeting in Glasgow from this weekend are failing on the measures needed to tackle climate change, both in the UK and globally. The UK government’s recently published net zero 2050 strategy is meaningless without a plan for how this will be achieved and how they intend to provide protections for workers and communities as we transition to a new decarbonised economy.

To make our demands heard, we are calling on all members to take part, in Covid-safe ways, in the national demonstrations planned in Glasgow and across the country on 6 November.

Union leaders write to leaders of the COP26 nations

COP26 negotiations involve government leaders and officials but largely exclude workers and worker representatives. General secretaries of PCS, Unite, FBU, the NEU and ten other unions have written to the leaders of the COP26 nations pointing out that “Workers keep our economies going. Without workers, there will be no transition to the economy we need for the future.

COP26 Global Day of Action.

World leaders meeting in Glasgow from this weekend are failing on the measures needed to tackle climate change, both in the UK and globally. The UK government’s recently published net zero 2050 strategy is meaningless without a plan for how this will be achieved and how they intend to provide protections for workers and communities as we transition to a new decarbonised economy.

PCS Ofgem Presents – Climate Movie nights! 9th and 11th November 5:30 – 6:15pm 
In light of COP26 being hosted in Glasgow, PCS Ofgem will be hosting 2 movie night discussions related to our Climate Emergency. These movies will be hosted over 2 nights via Zoom where we will be able to watch and then discuss points of interest and thoughts that we have resulting from the films.
 
The real truth behind Climate Change no one told you about - 9th November 5:30pm – 6:15pm
Facts, figures, images and information thrown at us when it comes to climate change, are our known facts correct? Have we got our thoughts on it all wrong? This short movie will focus on some apparent facts and will determine whether what we know is indeed Fact or Fiction.

This is just how unfair Climate Justice is – 11th November 5:30 – 6:15pm 
We're all living through the climate crisis. But we're not all in it together. So what exactly does climate change have to do with social injustice? And how can we fix it? This is climate justice explained.
this channel explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means and how the system needs to change.
	
Join our regional cost of living, pay and pensions campaign meetings

PCS is holding a series of meetings in every region and nation during November. The briefings will give members the opportunity to hear an update on the civil service pensions and discuss the next stages of our campaign on pay and the rising cost of living. As costs of living increase, without any increase in pay members can not afford, in real terms, a pay cut.

Pensions robbery – make your voice heard


A cut in employee pension contributions, that’s now worth more than £1,000 for many, should have brought in nearly 3 years ago. The government wants to rip up the rules so it would never be obliged to pass benefits on to scheme members in this way again – known as ‘cost-sharing’ provisions.

PCS has begun legal action to challenge the government blocking its own cost sharing provisions. The list of unions making a challenge includes FBU, PCS, POA, GMB and Unite. Employee contribution rates have remained unchanged in 2019, 2020 and 2021 – see how much this has cost you by using our calculator <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dfa3ae7a00b%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9e7cdaa61a61424e7ad608d9a5c514e2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637723089034429545%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2FvLe%2F5fJo%2FPdxR1zTJ%2FxAajvhfRUJgCfh0DMzsv9pK4%3D&reserved=0>  and share your loss on social media using the share buttons on the calculator page.

Despite the miserable weather spirits were wonderfully high, and this blog post <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D953f19bb12%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9e7cdaa61a61424e7ad608d9a5c514e2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637723089034449533%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=7fXdeMCO5gSesbjjjPmh9WBnQ9UBbqLIx63oay%2FNhLA%3D&reserved=0>  written by Lynn Henderson (Senior National Officer of PCS) succinctly highlights why climate action and trade unions go hand in hand.
	

DVLA staff vote to strike but anti-trade union laws curtail action


While 79% voted for action the mandatory 50% turnout threshold was not reached.

The DVLA dispute began earlier this year and staff have taken numerous days of strike action due to government ministers scuppering a deal <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Db704cdf6c1%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C9e7cdaa61a61424e7ad608d9a5c514e2%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637723089034459529%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Kkg6XuFohPUSzpoJ3zfM9Ye3fohrUfjuWC6dtVBM4LQ%3D&reserved=0>  to end the dispute in June.  

A PCS spokesman said: “It is frustrating for members who have voted for industrial action that they have been denied their democratic right to strike, due to some of the most repressive anti-trade union laws in Western Europe. 

“Our members are our number one priority, and we will continue to campaign for their health and safety at DVLA and across the civil service.”

Join our regional cost of living, pay and pensions campaign meetings

PCS is holding a series of meetings in every region and nation during November. The briefings will give members the opportunity to hear an update on the civil service pensions and discuss the next stages of our campaign on pay and the rising cost of living. As costs of living increase, without any increase in pay members cannot afford, in real terms, a pay cut.

Pressuring Ofgem on their commitment to the Real Living Wage

We’ve had a longstanding campaign to get Ofgem to pay staff a Real Living Wage. Despite Ofgem’s verbal commitment to a Real Living Wage, we haven’t seen as much of it in the OD as we would expect. We are continuing to pressure Ofgem to live up to their commitment and pay staff a wage they can afford to live on.
	
Disappointing response to our green letter
 
After COP26, there is more and more focus on actions rather than words. Whilst Ofgem encourages consumers and industry to decarbonise, we are not going on that journey ourselves. Ofgem has failed to commit to conducting an environmental audit which is essential to know areas where we are doing well or need improvement. We will continue to pressure Ofgem to recognise the climate emergency and take appropriate, and urgent, steps.

National campaign to fight the cost-of-living crisis

This week PCS have ramped up our fight against the cost-of-living crisis. We wrote in the Newsletter last week about the Great Pensions Robbery.

The fact that UK prices are soaring at the fastest rate for almost 10 years underlines the urgent need for the government to act on civil service pay as many PCS members face a bleak winter.

As fuel and energy prices surge <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3Dae9de53579%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C7970a2a467404440581908d9aa9e78c9%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637728421356771409%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=G%2FReHFLhncK8fig9vU27RTtnkwxjAXCgYRdzzwYmE5U%3D&reserved=0>  and the cost-of-living crisis deepens our members are feeling the pinch more than ever. The more of us who get involved in PCS’s national campaign, the more impact we can have to right these wrongs.

It is time for action, years of pay cuts and the pensions robbery are taking their toll. Get involved <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D48f8f1f32e%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C7970a2a467404440581908d9aa9e78c9%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637728421356781404%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=K5oe5VGsrlmVGHv4T7PoezXCcG31NQvjNgkZA9KylWk%3D&reserved=0>  with your union to make your voice heard. 
	
Life-changing legal win: ‘PCS was with me every step of the way’

PCS Ministry of Justice member, Tina (not their real name), was awarded more than £135,000 in compensation after being badly injured in a fall at work and turning to the union for help.

Tina, who is now retired and lives alone, says she could not have entertained the idea of financing her own legal case: “I cannot fault PCS for the support they gave me… they were with me every step of the way. Without them, I couldn’t have afforded to have done this. I just didn’t have any money. I would have risked losing my flat to pay for it. I’ve always said you need your union behind you.”

PCS MOJ Group Secretary Laura Bee said: “Our member’s injury could have been easily avoided had the MOJ just fixed the faulty door, but now her life has been changed forever. Her PCS membership gave her access to expert legal services free of charge, which meant her employer was held accountable and she’s kept 100% of her compensation.”

PCS responds to tragic deaths of migrants trying to cross the Channel

27 people drowned last night after trying to reach the UK in a small boat. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""The deaths of 27 people in the channel trying to reach the UK, is an absolute tragedy. It is shocking that the government is suggesting Border Force staff turn boats back, which will clearly be against international law and morally reprehensible. PCS is reviewing all its options, including taking out a judicial review against Priti Patel's plans and a possible industrial response.""

Get involved in the PCS National Pensions Campaign

Despite being the government’s own workers many members are struggling financially. Unless we see a significant pay rise in the region of 10% their living standards are set to go backwards.
Our members are feeling the pinch more than ever as the cost-of-living crisis deepens, on payday we are asking you get involved in our campaign to raise pay, pensions and living standards.

PCS joins legal action against government plans to pushback boats

PCS, the union representing Border Force staff, has joined Care4Calais in their legal fight to prevent Home Secretary Priti Patel from pushing back migrant Channel boats. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said:
“Our border force members are aghast at the thought they will be forced to implement such a cruel and inhumane policy. If the government does not abandon this appalling approach, we will pursue all legal avenues including a judicial review. PCS will not rule out all forms of industrial action, including disrupting the implementation of the Pushback policy if the Home Secretary insists on going ahead.”

The Royal Park’s cleaners concluded their month long (that’s right- month long!) strike with an accepted offer! Significant increases to members’ terms and conditions were agreed, including a huge increase in sick pay of up to 3 months which is so helpful. Read on about the success here <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D0ce41ddbe1%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C5a917b9b1d8b43575aeb08d9bc0524fe%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637747553717403122%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=uvsIssiQsgcXHJPuql8TdUXfzI%2BuLfUj2kqnSwpZuAE%3D&reserved=0> .

"PCS OD Update - Freedom of Information request results and draft statement [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

(Resending as the encryption seems to disable the voting buttons. That means I’m just expecting all of you to behave nicely ??)

 

Apologies for the slight lack of updates from the branch over the last few months. It has been a busy time for many of us. However, we have not been idle, and we have recently obtained a lot more material on the OD by way of a Freedom of Information request. 

 

As this information is now considered in the public domain, we are preparing to share this with you imminently. Mainly so you can help us analyse all of it ??. We also want to use this as an opportunity to set out an updated position on the OD, in light of the materials we have already reviewed, and the developments over the last few months. 

 

We are very mindful that we have not had a lot of engagement about the OD recently, but as the branch executive committee, we do need to make sure we represent your views, not just those of the committee members. So with that in mind, I have attached the draft statement we intend to circulate ahead of the all staff call on Thursday morning. This is draft and not for wider circulation. The purpose of sharing it now is to give you the opportunity to tell us if you endorse the statement or not. We will only issue it if we have sufficient support from the branch. 

 

Unfortunately we do not have time to make extensive changes to the statement, and so we cannot work it out with all of you until we have a consensus version. Instead, I ask that if you broadly agree with the statement, you use the ‘Approve’ voting button. If you are broadly unhappy with it, please use the ‘Reject’ voting button. If there are particular bits of feedback you would like us to know, please do email them, and we will take those into account as best we can. We will also run a members meeting tomorrow (Tuesday 14/12) over lunch to discuss the FOI, the statement, and our next steps.

 

If you have any questions, speak to one of us or drop us an email.

Branch News 	
Thanks to all members who joined the call on Tuesday about the OD and the Ofgem/McKinsey FOI response. We’re finalising the statement and will be circulating the docs shortly! There’s a lot of info to go through, so we’re crowdsourcing analysis.

Please do join in and infill your findings and analysis in the spreadsheet we have set up. Any specific points you want to share with us, email pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> 

On a more positive note, we could indicate that we've seen the grade pay levels plan and, without giving details, say it has taken into account the analysis we produced.

PCS seeks joint judicial review over pensions robbery
On the 14th December 2021, PCS and 5 sister unions applied to the High Court for a judicial review to force the government to give public sector workers the 2% cut in civil service pension contributions that they are owed.

"FOI material - McKinsey presentations - OD transformation statement [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members, 

 

Earlier this week, we circulated a draft statement on our recent Freedom of Information request to Ofgem on McKinsey’s work. We have updated our statement, which is now being sent directly to Ofgem, and is attached. You will also find attached some core McKinsey material from the FOI, as explained in the following:

 

 

PCS is both pleased and disappointed to inform members that we have recently obtained, through a Freedom of Information request, more information about the Organisational Design project. We are pleased, because it has been a common complaint of staff that they have had insufficient information and insight into the OD and its drivers to meaningfully engage with it. Yet we are also disappointed that we had to resort to an FOI to obtain this information, much of which we believe Ofgem could and should have shared proactively with staff in the interests of transparency and facilitating meaningful consultation with staff.

 

We will share all material with PCS members. We are doing this for two principal reasons: First, we believe that there is information that colleagues deserve to know about. The OD has had, and continues to have, a vast impact on our working lives. We believe that providing information on the OD is in all colleagues’ interests, and we believe that staff are capable of processing the material with regards to the context and materiality of proposals. Second, PCS is a democratic organisation. We have a mandate and obligation to work on behalf of our members. We have come into information provided for a public sector organisation, procured through public funding, that is relevant and of interest to members, and are not willing to censure what is made available to interested parties. 

 

We do, however, recognise our responsibility in taking this decision, and that there may be unintended consequences to the sharing of information. For instance, we are aware that the materials cover a long period of time and that the OD has evolved, so that earlier material does not necessarily reflect the OD as it stands today. Still, we think even the evolution of the OD provides good insight into the thought processes that have directed it, and helps to illustrate how the OD got here.

 

The structure of the information, as shared by Information Rights, is pretty chaotic. As the BEC, we’ve tried our best to look through stuff for pertinent and important information for members. A lot of people have told us that they have limited time to engage with transformation materials because their day jobs continue to be incredibly busy. Unfortunately, at present, looking through the files includes wading through duplications and taking time to try and piece together the order that they should go in. We are, therefore, very grateful to those who have come forward to volunteer to help us organise the files and we will start doing this straight after we’re back from the holiday break. We will organise so that they are ordered chronologically and index them in order to make them more usable for our members, as our experience of navigating these documents is one of frustration. 

 

We informed Ofgem HR of our intention to publish the full FOI materials, and proposed a method of information sharing that we believe is in our members interests. We are going to take a phased approach to releasing detailed documents, giving us time for organising them and pressing Ofgem HR to provide some accompanying information, ‘right to reply’ style. This should provide further transparency, detail and analysis from Ofgem HR alongside the slides, providing you, PCS members, with richer information to analyse. It will also provide more clarity and transparency on where early options were considered and discarded, when and why, mitigating against propagating outdated information. 

 

Today, we are releasing ‘end of phase’ slides from McKinsey, covering a significant volume of information and decisions through the course of the OD to date. This is to be followed in the new year by more detailed materials leading up to those decisions.

 

We continue to seek volunteers to help us analyse the FOI material, so that we can define batches of detailed slides for sharing. If interested in helping out, please contact us at pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk> .

"PCS statement on the OD selection process [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Dear members,

 

Welcome back from your holidays.

 

Statement on Selection Process

 

The end of 2021 saw attention shift from abstract design principles to the lived experience of the OD, with quite some uncertainty and unhappiness on the proposed selection processes for team managers. 

 

This week, we’ve kicked off our 2022 ExCo engagement with an open letter setting out seven clear requests to learn lessons from the portfolio manager selection process in order to improve the team manager selection process.

 

Please find attached the letter sent on behalf of members. We will, of course, keep you updated on developments.

 

McKinsey Freedom of Information material 

 

At the end of 2021, we circulated the ‘end of phase’ slides from McKinsey.

 

We are working with volunteers to sort the McKinsey FOI materials into some semblance of order so that we can share the outputs and so that you can draw information from them.

 

If you’d like to volunteer to help us do this, please reach out to Evan Williams, and if you already have we will be in touch soon!

 

Best,

"Happy new year from PCS Ofgem - come volunteer with us :)! [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Happy new year to our PCS members! 

 

We hope you’re returning to work rested and well - personally I’d take another month off but that’s me ??. 

 

I don’t know if anyone predicted 2021 going like this and all of us should be so proud of what we’ve achieved at work (be it big or little!) working remotely, during a full blown energy crisis and juggling the organisational design. 

 

You may be aware that this branch committee are forever looking to expand and engage with you to productively listen to concerns and work with Ofgem to make the workplace better for all of us. The whole work force is the union and if anyone’s new years’ resolution was to get involved with something different, there is no better time to help your branch - as frequently or infrequently you can like.

 

Below are some upcoming areas/positions we are hoping you may be interested to do – if you’d like a chat about anything just reply to this email and we’ll be in touch!

 

1.	Health and Safety rep (10SC): Do you care about the safety and wellbeing of your colleagues? Do trip hazards, inadequate ventilation and uncomfortable furniture really get your goat? Then you’re an H&S Rep in the making! To complement the brilliant work our Glasgow H&S rep does, we are looking for a London-based rep to help keep H&S at the forefront of what Ofgem does. The work H&S reps do is invaluable and time off on Ofgem’s time is permitted to complete training. 
2.	PCS Ofgem Equalities Committee: So much of what Ofgem does may directly or indirectly affect folk with protected characteristics (and characteristics less acknowledged!). And while Ofgem is now trying harder on D&I, history shows that it is the energy and ideas of staff that actually make the greatest difference. That is why we are rebooting our Branch Equalities Committee, with members representing the full range of protected characteristics. If you consider yourself to be from an under-represented group(s), you can help us identify concrete improvements we can bargain, negotiate and campaign for at Ofgem, alongside our friends in the staff networks.  Don’t hesitate to speak to Cheral Govind by teams or email if you have any questions! 
3.	Local reps: Last year we set our sights on having an ambassador for PCS in each portfolio, to connect with our members and spread the word about the good work we do. We’ve made good progress, but there are still many portfolios left to cover (particularly in Analysis & Assurance, Corporate Services, Communications, ESMS, Enforcement, General Counsel, Networks, Retail and Strategy & Decarbonisation). If you enjoy chatting with your colleagues and are proud of what the union does, then this is a very easy way in which you could help us out.
4.	Union Learning Reps: Love learning new things and wish you could do more of it here at Ofgem? Then the Union Learning Rep (ULR) role might be the one for you. As ULR, you will contribute to shaping Ofgem’s L&D offering, link up with the world of union learning, and help members navigate the L&D available to them (and there is certainly plenty!).
5.	Assistant Organisers: Like organising events, run campaigns, conduct surveys or just generally enjoy getting more people involved in our PCS community? Then it sounds like you’re an organiser at heart. You’ll have a lot of freedom about what you can get involved in with this role, so speak to Frank if you’d like to know more.
6.	OD Researchers: Missing those uni days when you got to really sink your teeth into an essay or research project? If you want help us digest the McKinsey documents we receive by an FOI, or even just interested in gauging what will be involved then reply to this email as soon as possible to be added to the list of researchers who have already kindly agreed to help.
7.	Other ways to help: Does none of the above appeal to you, but you’d still like to be more involved in the union? Nae worries! Speak to Frank about what else is possible. ??

 

A final request for all of us – we are forever raising IT tickets to stop directing our weekly newsletter to the junk/spam folder – whilst members can tell Outlook we are not junk, it doesn’t solve the issue for new members or those who haven’t got around to updating Outlook. We are calling on members to raise an IT ticket to get all emails from pcs@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:pcs@ofgem.gov.uk>  whitelisted. So we know how many people have done this please let us know using the voting buttons (open the email > click on Message > Respond > Voting Buttons) if you have or intend to raise this and do pass on any response you receive to this inbox. 

 

We look forward to hearing from you,

 

Cheerio,

Branch News 	
Organise with your union
 
Last week we put out a call for volunteers to take part in your union as we organise to make Ofgem a fairer and better place to work. It's never too late or too soon to get involved, we have a number of roles ranging in commitment, experience, and skills. Being an active part of your union can build our collective voice at work whilst also allowing you to up skill, re skill, earn qualifications and meet a new network of people in your workplace, around the country and across the world. 
	
Ofgem apologise for OD mistakes
 
There have been a number of high profile apologies this week. On the all staff call on Tuesday, we heard and apology a shift in tone in acknowledging the issues you have been raising with us about the OD. Whilst there is still considerable work to be done to rebuild trust and morale across the organisation after a draining pandemic, the biggest energy crisis in over 40 years and a badly managed restructure, there is a window of opportunity and we will continue to always positively represent your interests in discussions with Ofgem.
	
Raise an IT ticket to whitelist PCS Newsletter

Last week we also mentioned how we need you to raise an IT ticket to get the newsletter whitelisted. Thank you to those who have already done this. Many of you are still not receiving the weekly newsletter via Mailchimp as it is being sent to the junk folder. You can tell Outlook we’re not junk but it doesn’t solve the issue for new members or those who haven’t got around to updating Outlook. See step-by-step guide below on how to do this:

Campaigns and news 	
Update your details on PCS Digital ahead of PCS national ballot
 
Ahead of the PCS national ballot from 14 February to 14 March to support our campaign to raise pay, pensions and living standards, we want all our members to review and update the personal details we hold for them.

This is not a strike ballot. It will ask members what action they would be prepared to take. A statutory industrial action ballot might follow later.

To review your details, you will need a PCS Digital account <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcs-ofgem5416764354.us19.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D5b3186863c55fecfdfed2efbd%26id%3D817c9419a8%26e%3D83e756501f&data=04%7C01%7Crory.mccabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cd97e456dec7847051ba908d9d6941605%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637776754385485692%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=2OkzYPK5S%2BhLcwDj0Ni%2FRlZbpJRjIrAtVsDwYBA3MJU%3D&reserved=0> . If you haven’t registered for PCS Digital all you need to do on the online form is enter your surname, your first name and then your PCS membership number, which has 7 digits and starts with a P (you'll find it on any emails you've had from us). You then enter your personal email address and click on the sign-up button. You will then receive an email from us with instructions on how to set up your password.
	
Sign the petition to support Tracy Scholes
 
Tracey Scholes has been a bus driver at the Queens Road depot for the past 34 years. When Tracey started her journey as a bus driver in 1987 she was the first female bus driver employed at the Queens Road depot.

The industry back then was very male dominated and a woman taking a driving position was challenging to say the least however Tracey took the challenge and has had the full respect of all her colleagues.

Over the years Tracey has been instrumental in paving the way for other women to take up positions within the passenger sector. Go North West Ltd have refused to consider proposals from Tracey and her Unite trade union reps to keep her in employment. This has resulted in her unfair dismissal from Go North West Ltd for capability to fulfil her role a PCV driver.

The company’s only resolution is to offer Tracey a position in the company that would see Tracey’s pay and hours cut significantly leaving her in financial hardship.
