"Leaver Guidance [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*	Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Ccb4a586b76ef42b2c90408d9c4a61894%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637757040183922608%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Rv366KKeqa%2F4Bwl56ADMV1xBIOTaLtf%2BHJBGnAf5%2B0s%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*	Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

	
Current leave year start date

13/08/2021

Last day of service

23/01/2022

Annual leave entitlement

30

Carry over from previous year

6.5

Minus leave already taken

6

Pro-rated leave entitlement 

14.0

 

Line Manager 

 

As a member of your team is due to leave Ofgem there are a number of steps for you to follow, attached is the Leaver’s Checklist which will guide you through the process. This includes details on:

*	The Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Ccb4a586b76ef42b2c90408d9c4a61894%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637757040183932601%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=BL0qtmIowGl0iQO9zV6jXrhswak4ieNA6dRMNcXMonQ%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR): please complete the application with the employee if required. If the BAR is not required please email me to confirm this.

Hi Theresa,

 

Can you confirm Rory is contracted to only give 1 month notice then?  

 

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes:

"Hi","Hi Rory,

I hope your wife is faring ok around her visit this week.  I hope you both can enjoy a nice Christmas together and I wish you both the very best for the new year.

On your notice period HR were a bit trigger happy with their confirmation of one month notice as no-one actually agreed that yet.  I would like to speak to you and Liz/Sergio in Jan when everyone is back to agree how much knowledge and work there is to handover first as with only a very small team I don't want to leave us short.  If we can do that by the 23rd Jan as suggested then I am more than happy to agree to that date when we are back.


As you will be working between Christmas and new year, if you would like to start documenting your knowledge, the status and detail of any work you are unlikely to be able to finish, and a summary of any work you will be able to finish that will speed things up a lot.


Have a lovely Christmas and speak in January.

"RE: Hi [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Nick,

 

Hope you are feeling better before Christmas as you are showing off on sick leave.

 

I really appreciate your comments below about my wife and the notice period. Of course I will work to a handover plan and, if there’s not enough time between 5th and 21st January, we can extend it.

 

I have every confidence that Sergio and Liz can pick up the retail scripting and anything for Laura. ED2 should be able to maintain their templates going forward and we’ll cover off anything else as soon as we are all back.

 

I am not working before New Year but will pull together any documentation starting on 5th January.

 

Happy Christmas and New Year to you and your family,

Rory

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

"Re: Leaver Guidance [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi,

Based on our handover conversations this week I am happy to honour Rory's suggestion of ending early, not serving full notice and ending his contract on 23rd Jan.


We will have enough time to close off work and get feedback on the team members by this point.  Please reissue the required paperwork.


Thanks

Hi Theresa,

 

Can you confirm Rory is contracted to only give 1 month notice then?  

 

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

 

Thanks

Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*	Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C46a1c261fcf84fb63e5a08d9d1389057%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637770863128349236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=5%2B2RbGNKu0kmSF%2BT7ObCIVeTR2doi7SuqQfa3ypR53I%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*	Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

Hi,

 

Based on our handover conversations this week I am happy to honour Rory's suggestion of ending early, not serving full notice and ending his contract on 23rd Jan.

 

We will have enough time to close off work and get feedback on the team members by this point.  Please reissue the required paperwork.

 

Thanks

Hi Theresa,

 

Can you confirm Rory is contracted to only give 1 month notice then?  

 

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

 

Thanks

Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*	Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C98b4e21ce34b4220714908d9d1bce634%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771431509699540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=cT4qBhZkbzZrh%2BKvaDMULIF5UFakA2%2Bn1xORxWWrzDU%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*	Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

	
Current leave year start date

13/08/2021

Last day of service

23/01/2022

Annual leave entitlement

30

Carry over from previous year

6.5

Minus leave already taken

6

Pro-rated leave entitlement 

14.0

 

Line Manager 

 

As a member of your team is due to leave Ofgem there are a number of steps for you to follow, attached is the Leaver’s Checklist which will guide you through the process. This includes details on:

*	The Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C98b4e21ce34b4220714908d9d1bce634%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771431509699540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=cT4qBhZkbzZrh%2BKvaDMULIF5UFakA2%2Bn1xORxWWrzDU%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR): please complete the application with the employee if required. If the BAR is not required please email me to confirm this. 
*	Knowledge Capture: please discuss this with your leaver to ensure a smooth handover
*	Return of Property: please ensure your leaver returns all Ofgem property to you or the relevant department ahead of their last day in the office. 

If you have any questions at all, please let me know.

Hi,

 

Based on our handover conversations this week I am happy to honour Rory's suggestion of ending early, not serving full notice and ending his contract on 23rd Jan.

 

We will have enough time to close off work and get feedback on the team members by this point.  Please reissue the required paperwork.

 

Thanks

 

Nick

Hi Theresa,

 

Can you confirm Rory is contracted to only give 1 month notice then?  

 

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

 

Thanks

Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*        Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C98b4e21ce34b4220714908d9d1bce634%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771431509699540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=cT4qBhZkbzZrh%2BKvaDMULIF5UFakA2%2Bn1xORxWWrzDU%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*        Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

	
Current leave year start date

13/08/2021

Last day of service

23/01/2022

Annual leave entitlement

30

Carry over from previous year

6.5

Minus leave already taken

6

Pro-rated leave entitlement 

14.0

 

Line Manager 

 

As a member of your team is due to leave Ofgem there are a number of steps for you to follow, attached is the Leaver’s Checklist which will guide you through the process. This includes details on:

*        The Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7C98b4e21ce34b4220714908d9d1bce634%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771431509699540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=cT4qBhZkbzZrh%2BKvaDMULIF5UFakA2%2Bn1xORxWWrzDU%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR): please complete the application with the employee if required. If the BAR is not required please email me to confirm this. 

*        Knowledge Capture: please discuss this with your leaver to ensure a smooth handover

*        Return of Property: please ensure your leaver returns all Ofgem property to you or the relevant department ahead of their last day in the office. 

If you have any questions at all, please let me know.

Thanks all and can you note that there is no need to organise a courier for my equipment as I have to go into the Glasgow office at some time to clear my locker anyway so I can drop my kit in at the same time, maybe the weekend of the 22nd/23rd or the day after.

Hi,

 

Based on our handover conversations this week I am happy to honour Rory's suggestion of ending early, not serving full notice and ending his contract on 23rd Jan.

 

We will have enough time to close off work and get feedback on the team members by this point.  Please reissue the required paperwork.

 

Thanks

 

Nick

Hi Theresa,

 

Can you confirm Rory is contracted to only give 1 month notice then?  

 

I wasn't sure what he was contracted to serve but from the below it seems you are sure.

 

Thanks

Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*	Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cfb49c9c5470c4f478de308d9d1d0bd36%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771516720644886%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=5tUAmjb%2BSRE5lPpLinR2CLJCqLFjfsFxmp%2Fj%2BOQQUO0%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*	Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

	
Current leave year start date

13/08/2021

Last day of service

23/01/2022

Annual leave entitlement

30

Carry over from previous year

6.5

Minus leave already taken

6

Pro-rated leave entitlement 

14.0

 

Line Manager 

 

As a member of your team is due to leave Ofgem there are a number of steps for you to follow, attached is the Leaver’s Checklist which will guide you through the process. This includes details on:

*	The Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cfb49c9c5470c4f478de308d9d1d0bd36%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637771516720644886%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=5tUAmjb%2BSRE5lPpLinR2CLJCqLFjfsFxmp%2Fj%2BOQQUO0%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR): please complete the application with the employee if required. If the BAR is not required please email me to confirm this. 
*	Knowledge Capture: please discuss this with your leaver to ensure a smooth handover
*	Return of Property: please ensure your leaver returns all Ofgem property to you or the relevant department ahead of their last day in the office. 

If you have any questions at all, please let me know.

Hi Rory,

 

Employee

 

I am sorry to hear that you will be leaving Ofgem, I will record your last day of service as 23 January 2022 and your last working day as 21 January 2022 – if this changes please let me know. 

 

If you plan to take any annual leave ahead of this date please book on MyHR and also let me know. 

 

This email and attached documents will guide you and your line manager through the leaver process and includes: 

 

*	Details on the Business Appointment Rules <https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fguidance%2Fcrown-servants-new-jobs-and-business-appointments&data=04%7C01%7CRory.McCabe%40ofgem.gov.uk%7Cb45fade4d83042a54c6008d9da6e9454%7C185562ad39bc48408e40be6216340c52%7C0%7C0%7C637780990732389794%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=R13xd8X0UNY94%2BpbfTP8J9M6%2FlPJZAnVuxawm8oxj%2Fg%3D&reserved=0>  (BAR) and guidance completion. This needs to be completed as soon as possible with your line manager and this is in addition to the form which is part of your leaver letter. 

 

*	Information on the knowledge capture process - this is to get an understanding of your current role, tasks, responsibilities and relationships and will help you organise your handover and notice period. If you need support with this, contact the Knowledge Management team (KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk <mailto:KnowledgeManagementTeam@ofgem.gov.uk> )

 

We will arrange a courier to collect your equipment following your last day at Ofgem. To allow us to do this, please ensure your address and contact details are up to date on MyHR as soon as possible. Please note: you must return your building pass with your IT equipment. 

 

Please see attached guidance on how to complete your Exit Questionnaire via MyHR, if you would like to arrange an Exit Interview in person please contact Michelle Craig the Business Partner for your directorate. 

 

I have recalculated your annual leave up to your last day of service, minus any days you have already taken. Below is your remaining balance to use ahead of your last day of service (privilege days are not included in this calculation): 

 

Pro-rata for leavers:

As a member of your team is due to leave Ofgem there are a number of steps for you to follow, attached is the Leaver’s Checklist which will guide you through the process. This includes details on:

Hi,

 

Rory is joining and insurance company with no link to the energy industry or government and his role was given as a result of a normal, fair and open interview process so in my opinion this is fine.

 

Thanks

Subject: Dropping laptops off and clearing out locker [OFFICIAL Internal Only]

 

Hi guys,

 

Today is my last day :( so I’m planning to drop both my old Surface Pro and my Dragonfly into you guys in the Glasgow office sometime next week and also pick up my personal stuff that has been in the locker for nearly two years now!

 

Is there a best time/day to do this or a day to avoid from your point of view?

 

Thanks,

Rory
