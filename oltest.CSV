I hope you have had a good bank holiday.

 

As we have been discussing, the Data & Digital Insights team will be moving to a revised team structure this week. There are a few conversations left with team members which you will see in your diaries as 1-1s. I will send out formal emails once those have concluded.

 

This is the week that the focus will change from being fully scheduled through the Data Services Backlog and starting to work on D&D Programme led activities. I do know this a big change for you and also the DDaT team so please shout if anything is not clear or needs attention.

Subject: RE: Re-Application for Compressed Hours [OFFICIAL Internal Only]

 

Hi Rory,

Further to HR’s correction on the PH process and entitlement I would like to revert to my original request for every 2nd Monday as a non-working day.

As you are aware I’ve already started the compressed hours (01/06/2021) this request is just to change the pattern so that my NWD = every 2nd Monday.

I’ve added a nominal date for the change as 21/06/2021 as already have leave booked before this, so it will make it easier to switch days (and calculations) in a clear week.

 

I hope this is all in order.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

Thanks for investigating this further and supporting my request, much appreciated.

Liz

Subject: RE: Re-Application for Compressed Hours [OFFICIAL Internal Only]

 

Hi Rory,

Further to HR’s correction on the PH process and entitlement I would like to revert to my original request for every 2nd Monday as a non-working day.

As you are aware I’ve already started the compressed hours (01/06/2021) this request is just to change the pattern so that my NWD = every 2nd Monday.

I’ve added a nominal date for the change as 21/06/2021 as already have leave booked before this, so it will make it easier to switch days (and calculations) in a clear week.

 

I hope this is all in order.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

Thanks for investigating this further and supporting my request, much appreciated.

Liz

Hi Tony

 

Back in April/May, Rory and my roles were removed (Senior DBA), and we were taking on roles in the interim D&DI org, we haven’t yet received any contracts or formal confirmation since then, and given all the overall OD changes, not having an official/formal role is a concern.  I understand the contracts are with HR, do you have visibility of when we’re likely to receive them?

 

Kind Regards

Chris, Rory,

 

As discussed, please see the attached role profiles for the two roles outlined as part of the Interim D&DI organisation design. Both roles are equally important to us achieving our goal and will require significant collaboration inside and outside of the D&DI team. 

 

I will be in touch with each of you directly to discuss today / tomorrow.

 

Kind regards

Hi Tony

 

Back in April/May, Rory and my roles were removed (Senior DBA), and we were taking on roles in the interim D&DI org, we haven’t yet received any contracts or formal confirmation since then, and given all the overall OD changes, not having an official/formal role is a concern.  I understand the contracts are with HR, do you have visibility of when we’re likely to receive them?

 

Kind Regards

Chris, Rory,

 

As discussed, please see the attached role profiles for the two roles outlined as part of the Interim D&DI organisation design. Both roles are equally important to us achieving our goal and will require significant collaboration inside and outside of the D&DI team. 

 

I will be in touch with each of you directly to discuss today / tomorrow.

Really sorry for the delay in replying. 

 

You are in the posts as detailed from the email from Helen in April. I will get the People Centre to send a contract letter in the next few days. 

 

Thank you so much for your patience and I will process today.

Just wondering where it was at with the contracts for myself and Rory, do you know who in people’s centre is dealing with it so we can pester them?

Hi Tony

 

Back in April/May, Rory and my roles were removed (Senior DBA), and we were taking on roles in the interim D&DI org, we haven’t yet received any contracts or formal confirmation since then, and given all the overall OD changes, not having an official/formal role is a concern.  I understand the contracts are with HR, do you have visibility of when we’re likely to receive them?

 

Kind Regards

Chris, Rory,

 

As discussed, please see the attached role profiles for the two roles outlined as part of the Interim D&DI organisation design. Both roles are equally important to us achieving our goal and will require significant collaboration inside and outside of the D&DI team. 

 

I will be in touch with each of you directly to discuss today / tomorrow.

 

Kind regards

"Urgent: reorg interview process [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Helen,

 

In reading the latest communication between the PCS union and Ofgem today, I noticed the following statement:

 

We understand that Band C and D staff who exercise the option to apply for ring-fenced interviews and are not successful will go through the same redeployment and redundancy process as Band E and SCS. We believe that for these employees, the role they would have slotted into likely remains available, and hence ask Ofgem to give assurances that if unsuccessful, these staff will be slotted into these roles as if they had not opted to do a ring-fenced interview first.

 

Over and above my wish to progress in my career in Ofgem and given that my substantive role no longer exists or is yet to be determined, there is an expectation that I will interview to hold the interim role which I have been doing since the beginning of May. This leaves me no valid choice but to go for something with no guarantee of success and no assured fall-back position.

 

Can I ask you to push for clarification (if the above is incorrect) or adjustment (if it is correct) before I am left with a crucial decision which is actually a Hobson's choice?

"RE: Urgent: reorg interview process [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Rory

 

I have enquired with HR and have the following response, which is in line with our discussions the last few weeks.

 

As Rory is in a temporary post, his ringfence rights are based on the grade and responsibilities of his substantive post, whether that substantive post still exists or not.

Hi Helen,

 

In reading the latest communication between the PCS union and Ofgem today, I noticed the following statement:

 

We understand that Band C and D staff who exercise the option to apply for ring-fenced interviews and are not successful will go through the same redeployment and redundancy process as Band E and SCS. We believe that for these employees, the role they would have slotted into likely remains available, and hence ask Ofgem to give assurances that if unsuccessful, these staff will be slotted into these roles as if they had not opted to do a ring-fenced interview first.

 

Over and above my wish to progress in my career in Ofgem and given that my substantive role no longer exists or is yet to be determined, there is an expectation that I will interview to hold the interim role which I have been doing since the beginning of May. This leaves me no valid choice but to go for something with no guarantee of success and no assured fall-back position.

 

Can I ask you to push for clarification (if the above is incorrect) or adjustment (if it is correct) before I am left with a crucial decision which is actually a Hobson's choice?

Hi Rory

 

I have enquired with HR and have the following response, which is in line with our discussions the last few weeks.

 

As Rory is in a temporary post, his ringfence rights are based on the grade and responsibilities of his substantive post, whether that substantive post still exists or not.

Where the substantive post doesn’t exist in the old or new structure, he should be mapped to a role at his substantive grade on a best fit basis.

You will be mapped to the D role even if you apply to the Head of Role. If no-one else is mapped to the D role then you will slot in there if you are not successful for Head of. This is the current position – ie there is no one else currently mapped alongside you.

"RE: Quick question - how my current and possible future roles will be decided [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Hi Laura and thanks for the chat Monday.

 

After reading the PCS document emailed to us this morning, specifically “D staff who exercise the option to apply for ring-fenced interviews and are not successful will go through the same redeployment and redundancy process”, I had a long back and forth email with my manager Helen Crooks (CDO and HoP for data) who called in and quoted HR on my questions to clarify the slot-in/interview process for my interim role.

 

Five points got clarified:

 

-      With respect to my Senior DBA role not existing to fall back into: “As Rory is in a temporary post, his ring-fence rights are based on the grade and responsibilities of his substantive post, whether that substantive post still exists or not.”

 

-      She had said previously that the HoPs would spend September role-mapping but this seems to have been already done according to IT: “This is what we have done, in mapping him to a suitable band D role.”

 

-      This slot-in may need to be interviewed for: “If someone else also maps in the next few weeks to the same D role then there will be an interview process.”

 

-      Confirmation of my interim status: “Rory is in a temporary post”

 

-      Most importantly, my question based on the above excerpt from consultation documents/feedback was whether I’d be at risk if not selected after interviewing for the E role I’m currently doing as interim: “you will slot in there if you are not successful for Head of.”

 

I pushed on this as it seemed to be the opposite of the stated policy above and could be interpreted as her opinion in an email and she replied: “ Given I have explicitly asked HR the point, I would take it that this is clarification of the redeployment process in this instance.”

 

There are still questions to be answered, like which new D role I’ve been mapped to, whether I have a choice on this, my grade mapping being stuck as 2c without taking the temp promotion into account, whether I can challenge this and if I can get paid for being in an interim E role since May (let alone what you and I discussed about SCS process) but this does seem to be some clarification.

 

I hope you can use this to clarify the general position and fill in some of the gaps in the consultation if it can be taken as policy rather than one person’s interpretation of policy albeit with written HR support.

 

As for taking it forward officially for myself and Chris, we are in the difficult position of waiting to see what career our manager / CDO / HoP maps out for us and whether she is on the interview panel that dictates our future. For now, we think we should wait but I’m still curious to know if policy has been followed with regards to what we discussed the other day.

 

As always thanks for your help in this,

Rory

Hi,

 

Just wanted to updated you that the letters are done and with Helen for review. (She does not work on a Friday and so will review on Monday). 

 

I just wanted to make sure that the letters reflect the discussions she had with you but the letter confirm your current role. 

 

Once again, I do apologise for the delay and thanks for your continued patience.

Thanks again for your patience. 

 

I am preparing the contract amendment letter now and getting it checked. 

 

Rest assured however that you are in these roles but I course understand that you require formal confirmation from HR.

Hi Tony

 

Back in April/May, Rory and my roles were removed (Senior DBA), and we were taking on roles in the interim D&DI org, we haven’t yet received any contracts or formal confirmation since then, and given all the overall OD changes, not having an official/formal role is a concern.  I understand the contracts are with HR, do you have visibility of when we’re likely to receive them?

 

Kind Regards

Chris, Rory,

 

As discussed, please see the attached role profiles for the two roles outlined as part of the Interim D&DI organisation design. Both roles are equally important to us achieving our goal and will require significant collaboration inside and outside of the D&DI team. 

 

I will be in touch with each of you directly to discuss today / tomorrow.

I mentioned the department headcount/budget plan that has been in existence since last April or earlier as proof that the (interim) head of data insight role is indeed at Band E.

 

Below is a snapshot showing ‘my role’ at row 29. In every version of this file right up to the current one dated 20th September (see second snapshot below), you can see it defines this role and other ‘head of’ roles including Chris’s as Band E (column G) for an existing employee (column I) in role from April last (column O).

"RE: Document showing my interim role as an E banded post [OFFICIAL Internal Only]","Absolutely. Can you save a copy of that locally? If you can give me sight of the role profile you were given I can try and run it past a job evaluation accredited assessor – we have a few in the union. 

 

Ideally we’d have the role profile for the E role for application, but since that may be delayed for some time it’s probably best to work with what we’ve got to hand now.
